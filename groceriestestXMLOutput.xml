<text>not worth the money!
I am doing this review through my husbands account, so don't pay mind to the name! Sorry!   I love all the Gillette Razors! I tried this Razor at my sisters house, and loved it as well. So, I went out and bought it at Sam's club. The first day was wonderful, and then the second was OK, and then by the third day I couldn't use it! So, i have to replace the heads every three days? I don't think so! On that third day I had to use a lather soap, which I shouldn't have to use since the head has gel built into it! I really don't think it is worth the money. <text>

<text>Undecided
I've been lifting for about 8 years now and I'm 6'1, about 240 lbs with 18'' arms and a 49'' chest.  I'm telling you this as I've gotten to the point where I've plateaued in my lifting and I was looking for a way to get beyond the plateau. With that out of the way, I'm not sold on this product at all and I didn't notice any change what so ever when taking these pills.  So after taking them for about two months, my conclusion is they do not work for me.  Also, pretty much all the amino acids in these pills are available in most protein shakes and the protein shakes offer more in the way of protein.<text>

<text>Slimey but edible if you're hungry
After reading the positive reviews here and ordering this product myself, I have to ask, are we talking about the same stuff? Because what I received was not "amazingly delicious" but was, frankly, a little slimey. That's not what I'm looking for in a dinner. Maybe it was the potatoes. I don't know. I wish I could return this. I feel bad donating it to charities. I don't think they'll like it any more than I do.<text>

<text>Old Tech Sports Drink
I tried the premix version before I bought the 24 oz. powder. It was good and I liked the taste. Unfortunately, the powder version had Herbal Lift. The full effects of the herbal ingredients are not proven so if I take any of them, I take them separately and don't want them mixed in with any other supplement.ProsI liked the tasteSucrose and Aspartame FreeConsWill not dissolve in cold water (turns into a gummy substance)Crystalline FructoseArtificial FlavorHerbal Lift version caused sleep disturbanceGives a slight unsettling of the stomach which during the course of an event is not a positive influence.I am looking for an alternate to G without fructose or sugar and provides electrolytes. I am now trying Hammer HEED which has a milder taste and more natural ingredients. <text>

<text>Not as good as Kettle Valley fruit bars.
This was on sale and I thought I would try to save a little money by buying it over the Kettle Valley brand of organic fruit bar. Well the 2 year old taste arbitrator was unimpressed. Where she devoured the Kettle Valley, she lingered over this brand (and frequently did not finish it). And it wasn't a question of the variety. She had liked all incarnations of Kettle Valley that I had purchased. She did not really like the only incarnation of this brand that was purchased. Now I'm eating the remainder and I'm unimpressed also. It is bland and waxy tasting.<text>

I will never order this product again from Amazon. I mean, our daughter loves this formula, and it's very useful when you aren't home and need to feed your baby. Unfortunately during the shipment they broke at least 10 bottles, and I found a mess inside the box. I suppose they should use a special packaging for it.<text>

<text>Review of company
I love the product, but want to complain about the company that sent the product(PickledE).  I was expecting twice the amount of popcorn than I received--in other words,the way they worded it, I was ripped off--for what I paid for it, I could find twice the amount. And I emailed the company, there was no phone number, just an email...and I got no response from them.  I searched for their company on the web and didn't find anything either. I trusted every company that sold products through Amazon and now I do not. I hope I don't have to worry about my financial information through this non-existing company.<text>

<text>Anyone want the rest of mine?
Strongly horrible tasting.  I've been enjoying smoothies that are more than half greens (kale, chard, etc.) with chia and ground flaxseed thrown in - so it's not as if I demand 100% sweet - but this stuff, even at a quarter of the recommended dosage, takes "must be good for you" to a new level.  Or should I say "to a new low."<text>

<text>Not for Dark Blend Coffee Drinkers
I am a fan of other Timothy K Cups, but not this one. I tried it based on the reviews, but unfortunately it is not that strong. Of course it's a matter of taste. I prefer the darker blends, but if you are someone who prefers a "not so strong" coffee than I guess you would enjoy it. Don't get me wrong, it does not taste bad, just too weak for my preference. <text>

Worked great for about a month (using it 2-3 times per week), then the glue that held the bristles in place failed causing chunks of the hairs to fall out of the handle. Not worth the aggravation. Going to pay double for a better quality brush.<text>

<text>Not for the Asians who like Dark Tea
Well, Twinnings are one of the best brands and I was hoping go for it. But this specific one is not as dark or strong as some of the South Asian folks would like to have. Its great if you are just having it without milk. But if you want to have a strong morning tea, this is not the right kind. I think the Assam blend is probably the best but I couldnt find the one I got from U.K. The flip side of Amazon order is I cant return the rest of the unopened boxes ( it comes with 6 boxes, as you know). I tried to use two tea bags on one cup of tea but it still doesnt give me the kick.... so I have to say, as much as I wanted to like it for the price and convenience, I am going to give the rest of the boxes away to freinds and family as gifts whilst I still look for that Assam blend or strong dark liqour of black tea,,<text>

It's been two months since I put a bunch of cotton balls drenched in oil all around my garage.  We are still catching mice - think we've had four.  I've doused the cotton balls a total of three times; maybe every 3 weeks.  Maybe I need to do it more often?It does make the garage smell nice, but it hasn't really helped with our field mouse problem.  Oh, well....<text>

Our family loves these granola bars normally. The shipments we have received have gotten worse each time. The current shipment we have, the bars are mostly hard but the chocolate chips are not good as well. They are very light brown and turn into a crumbly mess when you bite in. I recommend just buying them at your local store or to try another brand. Sorry for the bad review we really loved these at one time!<text>

<text>Might be healthy, but won't be buying again. . . .
I've tried a number of protein bars or low carb type, and would have to say that these were the least enjoyed.  In fact, the taste did so little for me (not to mention aftertaste), that I pitched the last four.  I hate wasting food, or anything for that matter, but the alternative was to let them go stale in the pantry.  The texture was decent, but taste -- ugh -- waste of calories. <text>

If there's a Whole Foods store near your home or work, they sell this product for 30-50 cents less, per package and you won't have to wait for delivery.  And, if you are sugar-sensitive, don't buy this flavor...it's a little too sweet.<text>

are glucose syrup and evaporated cane juice? Just because these ingredients are organic doesn't mean they're healthy. I worry that we are giving our kids the implied message that sugar is good.

<text>cologne is suspected to be fake, Amazon Custumer Service is great
Amazon is my favorite online store, but I've never bought cologne from them. This is the first time buying cologne here, and the cologne appears to be fake. The plastic wrap is resealed. The package is cut inside (check out the customer image I just posted some pics on there). The cologne smells too much alcohol, and it doesn't last long. I think it wasn't shipped from an Amazon warehouse; it was shipped from their partner's. Even though the shipping label has amazon logo on it, the shipping box isn't what amazon usually uses. The receipt is different too. Nevertheless, Amazon Customer Service is great. They give me a full refund, and I don't have to return the cologne back. It now becomes my paperweight. 5 stars is for Amazon CRS, 0 star for the cologne quality = 2 stars total :). This cologne smells great if you get the real one. <text>

<text>Not very good stuff
I don't really understand all the good reviews this stuff is getting; to me Serious Mass tastes really bad and is very thick and hard to even stomach especially before an intense workout. This is all being mixed with 2% milk by the way (in order to maximize the calories). Being a college student I have no access to a blender and have just been using a shaker bottle. Whenever I take this product it gives me an incredible amount of gas and sometimes even a bit of nausea. I could not possibly imagine taking 2 full servings of this crap every day. If you ask me Muscle Juice is a much better more palatable product. I understand that the Juice has many more simple carbohydrates in it and that Serious Mass has more complex carbohydrates but I would still choose the Juice. Personally I don't not think it matters a whole lot how one gets the calories required to build muscle provided the body is being vigorously stimulated to grow muscle. This shake also tends to make you feel very full (either because of actual fullness or gas I do not know) where as Muscle Juice doesn't. It was because of this full feeling I actually felt like I was getting in less calories than I was without taking the gainer because I could not eat as much with other regular meals. So to summarize: Pros:more complex carb source than other weigh gainersless expensiveCons:pasty texturehorrible tastecauses lots of bloatinghard to mix w/o blenderAs this is a personal review, only my results are depicted and this product my work better for other for other people. <text>

<text>Sucralose, what a shame
I was quite excited when I ordered this product because chai is one of my favourite hot drinks.  However, upon my first sip almost all I could taste was the Sucralose.  It was like licking a metal pipe with spices sprinkled on it.  I hadn't paid attention to the ingredients prior to that point but the use of Sucralose was obvious.  If you're sensitive to artificial sweeteners, like Sucralose, you probably won't like this product.  Otherwise, it seems like it has potential.  I might have liked it if it didn't use artificial sweeteners but as it is I won't buy this product again.<text>

First time I've used this coffee, and there is nothing distasteful about it. I just find it to be a little mild (anemic?) for my taste.<text>

<text>Well, it isn't sand paper...
I'm all for saving the environment and I try to do my part, but this particular bathroom tissue is less than friendly to the bottom.  They are effective, but not so comfortable.  I know that there is a grocery store chain that makes much more comfortable recycled paper.<text>

<text>Scalp problem products
I was disappointed with this product as it has not really helped my itchy (non-dandruff), dry scalp from sensitive skin, being diabetic and over-coloring.  I have not found this to be any sort of real scalp therapy that works.  It is a nice light shampoo, smells pretty good even though there is tea tree oil in it, but it does not work as advertised.  I am now using homeopathic remedies on my itchy, dry scalp such as applying this:  Simmer 12 tbsp. plain, old fashioned oatmeal in 6 cups boiling water for an hour. Strain oatmeal, reserving the cooking water to which you then add 5 drops rosemary and 5 drops lavender oil. I have also substituted warm virgin olive oil for those two oils, and mixed 1/2 C. of the reserved oatmeal water with 6 Tbs. apple cider vinegar.  Allow mixture to cool before applying to scalp. Leave in hair at least 10 minutes before washing out. You can use this once a week to relieve dry scalp. <text>

<text>not good for me
I used this product because I was told it was created without chemicals by the inventors  for his wife who had cancer.  How true this story is I don't know however it irrated my scalp I give it only one star as I am sensative to many chemicals. If you are sensative I would not recommend this.<text>

The product itself was satisfasctory, but it came  USPS with $.40 due postage. The batteries only cost $1.49, but they already charged $4.79 for shipping &amp; handling. It really ticked me off that it should come with postage due. Don't they KNOW what postage is required to reach  any destination. All S&amp;H charges are a big rip-off anyway .......<text>

<text>Needs a flavor boost
We bought these bars for our teenage son who has celiac/sprue. Tasty GF sports nutrition is hard to find. These bars have great ingredients. We tried the chocolate brownie and there is just not enough flavor. They have that funny /vitamin taste you find in some sports bars. My daughter tried one and she thinks they taste "like window cleaner smells."  A total bust for us, nobody will eat them.<text>

<text>Yuck!
I do not like the taste of this "sugar" at all!  The only good thing about this is that it's all natural.  But it tastes just like chemical sweeteners to me!  And I was expecting a more natural taste.  Also, it is extremely sweet.  The taste is not something that I could enjoy everyday, only if I was in real need of a sweetener other than sugar.  I'm disappointed.<text>

<text>Eau du Anti-Histamines
I'm sorry, but this is another pop-star fragrance that I really don't care for (another being Britney Spear's "Curious").I was given a sample of it at Walgeens the other day. It's too sweet smelling for my tastes (my mother said it smelled like air freshener), and I think I had an allergic reaction to it.I got a rash.  Also, that night I woke up to find my left eye was starting to swell shut (I had not even sprayed it on my skin that time).  After removing contaminated articles of clothing and using hydrocortizone, symptoms vanished within an hour. Take that, Hillary Duff. <text>

I have the Bandit product and got another one but wanted something that I can alternate and wear at work without looking like a lost squash player. This did not give me any relief and after adjusting it every which way it just did not cut the mustard. The only time it gave me relief was when it also kept blood flowing to my fingers. I would give it one star but I am going to use it as a fancy - and pricey - cuff guard instead so I don't get chain grease on my trousers. <text>

<text>Not as "intense" as I expected
Just to get to the point of this product I think the intent was there but the end result was not as "intense" as the product could be.I have been an avid customer of the KY warming product as my husband and I use it and I thought this one would be interesting to try. The price tag alone would turn me away from purchasing it as it seems out of touch with most budgets including mine for the amount of product you receive.This product does produce a tingly cooling sensation as promised but it really did not enhance the intimacy or make it worth the hype of the brochure enclosed in the box.  I would rather use the warming product as it enhances the experience for both partners and doesn't have lingering tingling sensations after the experience is over.<text>

<text>I'll stick with the conventional cooking method......
Have enjoyed Annie's White Mac &amp; Cheese very much, but this microwavable variety is more trouble than its worth.  You must use a very deep &amp; wide bowl to use in the microwave or the water will boil over and you'll be left with very hot, uncooked macaroni in the bowl and a starchy mess in the microwave.  It is much easier to make the conventional variety in a pot!  <text>

<text>A bit of a disappointment from Twining's usual good quality
I have prepared this tea according to instructions and how I prepare every other cup of tea: Steep about 4 minutes. However, this tea is either dry or I got a strange batch because it becomes quite bitter very quickly. The sweet, floral jasmine flavor is present but again--with a bitter tinge. And I'm not about to start putting sugar in my tea. I won't be buying it again.<text>

<text>Not as good as it used to be...
My children and I have eaten Annie's macaroni &amp; cheese for over ten years and loved it. So it was to my dismay when I began to notice in the last year that the flavor was obviously reformulated to be much weaker. The directions were also reconfigured. It used to be 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of milk; now it calls for 1/4 cup of milk, which is why the outcome is so runny and yucky. My children have never eaten Kraft mac &amp; cheese, so we were comparing the difference in taste with the original Annies. I honestly expect that my family will wean themselves of Annies mac &amp; cheese because the flavor is that disappointing and bland.<text>

This is the only Olay Definity product I've found that is fragrance-free and has UV protection, a necessity for my morning routine.  It's intriguing to apply a foam moisturizer, but it's not quite moisturizing enough for my combination skin.  Also, no matter how I apply it, the product flakes off, leaving my skin covered with little flakes.  (I follow the product with a foundation powder, perhaps that's a bad combination).  I'm back to Olay Total Effects. <text>

Eh, not that great. It's very runny so you have to be quick before you get more on your palm than on the intended area. No noticeable tingle for me like the other products I've used.

I was expecting a lot more from a tea that is named "Double Bergamot". Some other Earl Grey's I have used have more Bergamot flavoring in 1 tea bag then this little tea in 4.

<text>Started out well.
I bought this back in 2006, and it worked well for the first year or so, recharging the batteries in the kid's toys. However after a year sometimes the charger would give a green light saying the battery was charged even after it had only been in for 5 mins or so. Taking the battery out and putting it in would fix it, but then another year or so, it would stop charging (the red light would turn off) in one of the bays, meaning I only could charge 3 batteries at a time. A few weeks ago, another bay is not working properly. I think that a charger costing this much should last longer than a few years given that it has no moving parts to fail.<text>

Two of the cans arrived damaged in shipping.  There is no way to contact amazon.  Campbell's sent me $1 coupons but the least I could find the product for was $1.59.  I would have been out of pocket $1.18 to replace the 2 cans of soup, however, none of the local markets carried clam chowder in soup at hand.  The cheapest Campbell's clam chowder I could find was over $2.  Being out a couple of bucks isn't too bad but suppose it were more money.  Amazon evidently does not stand behind what they sell.  They do not respond to emails to customer service and provide no other contact information.  <text>

This product does not do such a great job of moisturizing your face. After using it for a week, I didn't feel like my skin was really benefitting from it.But worse: it makes my eyes burn.<text>

<text>First time use, and pretty much last time as well
If u dont hav special requirement for condom, like allergy of latex.... i dont think this one is a good choice, first of all, the small of it is not that lovely, pretty much turned us down at the moment u open it. And worst part u have to hold it when u r "out" to take it out, if not u would hav the danger to get out the "glory hole" fully naked! Bought it just for curiosity, but pretty much not again!<text>

<text>Hasn't worked for me, yet
Hasn't worked for me yet, but there is still hope. I have some serious ulcers that erupt often, and with that comes the gas. Some ulcer patients don't pass gas easily, so it bloats and rumbles around in there for days, always with more pain than simple discomfort. My brother got me some of this hoping it would help, and although I've tried it with every meal, I don't recognize any difference. Perhaps it takes a bit of time. I'm just not sure what to expect. I DO, however, know what to expect of myself with various foods I eat, and so far, nothing has changed. Maybe I need to give it more time. If I see it helping, I'll revise my review at a later time.<text>

Maybe the other flavors are different, but this one had a greasy film and was very intensely cashew flavored.  Somehow more cashewy than a handful of cashews--in a bad way for me at least.  Very difficult for me to finish even one over an entire afternoon so I shared them with my office mates who are health nuts.<text>

<text>Florida girl looking to loose some weight
I read all the reviews about how great of a product the tea was so I decided to give it a try. The big question Im sure your wondering is did I loose any weight? The answer is NO! The tea works as a great cleaner. If you are going to use the tea just make sure your home or near the restroom, because it will give your the runs. I'm still finishing up the tea before I can tell you what the full affects are. I must admitt the shipping is great, the product arrived to my house within about 3 days or so. The tea has a smooth taste, so it doesn't taste too bad either. I guess this product helps some people loose weight and other it doesn't.<text>

<text>How effective is Triple Flex?
Frankly I don't know if I am benefiting from the use of this nutritional supplement for my arthrtic knee. I have used it for more than 6 months along with drugs designed to alleviate the pain associated with osteo arthritis. The only way to assess the effectiveness of the drug or the supplement is to stop taking them for a while. Which I am averse to. One gets addicted to  these things, especially at my age! I sincerely regret not being specific. My rating may not be fair.<text>

<text>Tastes good when you mix it w/ other coffees, but by itself...Um NO!
I absolutely LOVE white chocolate so I was extremely happy to see this. That was until I actually tasted it. 2 words, WATERED DOWN! I have the platinum keurig, so I have a choice on the cup size, and even the smallest size is too watery. It helps to add some half &amp; half or milk though. Or use it as a way to spruce up a coffe, then your coffee will have a semi white chocolate java feel going on.<text>

<text>Not very intense
The K-Y Brand Intense Arousal Gel for her was not very intense. After being married for 20 years my husband and I have tried different products over the years and this one did not stand out in the crowd at all. It gave me a slight cooling sensation and that was it. This is a product that will probably work differently with different people since body chemistry comes into play with how this will react with your body. For me, it wasn't anything I would go out of my way to look for or buy again. It did have a nice slippery feeling to it, but you can get that feeling out of a much cheaper product in the KY line. Looks like I'm one of the unlucky 25% that this product doesn't work on.<text>

There have been a lot of fake blades going around on the internet from what I understand.  I'm not sure if these were or not but I can say that they were not good.  The blade was shaky and buzzed when I turned on my razor. (I have the vibrating style) And the blades seemed like they were not in the right place as they felt like they were jagged and cutting me.I can't recommend this product and will go back to buying my razors in Duane Reade or CVS.<text>

Yes, this product does smell like "old lady".  I have used it for 3 months morning and night and have not seen any noticeable lightening so I have stopped using it now.  It does however, leave my skin really soft, but the smell is so strong that it gives me a headache.  The first time I tried it, I put a small dab on my hand and was embarrassed by the smell of it since I was at work at the time.  <text>

At roughly 55 cents (subscribed price) per unit, I unfortunately found out (too late) that this was at least 20 cents more than my local grocery store. I called Amazon and there was nothing they would do about it. I suggest checking out pricing at your local grocery store prior to purchasing this item. Don't make the same mistake I did. Its a good product, but sadly overpriced on Amazon.com<text>

<text>Scent gives me severe headaches
I have purchased the other cottonelle wipes (in white package) for years and been very happy with them. I assumed the Cottonelle for Kids was simply a smaller version of these, so when I saw them on sale, I ordered them.Who knew one,that they would be so heavily scented and two, that the smell/scent of these would be so horrendous that I'd develop severe headaches? I cannot even have them inside the plastic box/containers in the room without a headache developing. I am going to contact amazon.com to see if I can return the remaining packs. Huge waste of money for me if I can't since I can't use them.I don't understand why anything marketed for children would have such a heavy and awful scent to it.Would NOT recommend these to anyone due to the scent issue. (Yes, scent is personal, but I don't have severe headaches when using other scented personal care products.)<text>

I've used several brain supplementsover the years and realized that ingredients do matter.If you're ever going to take adietary supplement, read the label.As for me, I've only had success withSmarterFocus, which is availableon their website.Please do a comparison with supplementalfacts before ever listening to themarketing hype.As for brain support, don't just take the supplements, do some exercises.I HIGHLY suggest the game BRAIN AGE bynintendo.  It's amazing how well itconditions your brain.Cheers,Arthur<text>

<text>Still caking problem
I purchased two of these packages in mid Jan 2007.  I have only finished one box (of four) and am finding about 1 out of 4 packets have caked.  Due apparently to a small air leak in the packet so moisture can get in (only my personal theory).  I just pound on the packet with a knife handle to break it up and use it anyway but it is a problem.  And they have known about it now for a long time, seems like they would have solved the problem.....<text>

My family is gluten intolerant. Was hoping for a roll that replaces the good old one made from wheat flour. Has the same shape - albeit larger -  but the bread overpowers the taste of a hot dog..I did find that if you remove most of the inside part of the bun and put in two hotdogs that the taste improves and its not so "bready". Was not overly impressed but since we cannot eat wheat this so far is the best I've found."in the valley of the blind, the one eyed man is king".<text>

I was happy to finally have my favorite Taco Bell flavors here in my home, ready to microwave when I'm up at 3a.m. watching Million Dollar Duck, but I don't know if I appreciate the deliberate misspelling of "bowls" Who is the spell checker at Taco bell, Prince? Was it 2 hard 4 you to spell this correctly? This isn't 1990, Taco Bell. I get it- Sante fe bowls are hip, they're happening, and they are indeed hot literally and figuratively. I will not be talked down to by your product, though. I'm a grown-up with grown-up tastes, and I'll never have the taste for a mess of "bowlz". Fix this!  <text>

It works by raising blood pressure and pulse to mimic light exercise, and it does result in fat loss.The downside?  There is no indication on the directions that the pills must be taken with food.  Today, I took two without eating.  In about ten minutes, I vomited them.  This is a complete anomaly for me.  In my 31 years, I've only ever vomited when I had the flu:  my gut is ironclad.<text>

<text>Makes my scalp flaky and itchy
I don't color my hair and never have, but I started using the shampoo about three weeks ago and the conditioner for about a week now and for the last 2 days I've noticed my scalp is getting very itchy along the hair line, which I didn't have before.  It also seems to be causing a lot of flaking even more than I normally would have. My scalp seems to be drying out or something.  I'm wondering if this is the process of it exfoliating my scalp and I should stick with it or is it just drying out my scalp too much.  I never had a problem with itchy scalp before using this product. I'm glad I didn't overpay for these products.  I found them at Costco and they were priced very low compared to what I have seen elsehwere.<text>

<text>Major Price Increase!!
I purchased 3 3-box cartons of Instant Breakfast through Amazon in March 2008.  They were priced a third of what they are currently.  Too bad, it was convenient to order from Amazon for this, but apparently "buy locally" is the only option I can afford.<text>

<text>Decent
These have a great crunch and it's great that it's low fat. However, it's way too salty. 280mg per serving is more than twice the amount of regular flavor chips like Lays. The cheddar and sour cream and onion flavor is delicious but also way too salty and too much sodium for my taste buds or health.<text>

<text>Okay, but not great
I thought I was going to like this product as a creamer for my daily coffee habit. However, after trying, I am disappointed. The flavor isn't too bad. It's the problem with the concoction not mixing well with coffee. if you use a clear glass mug, you'll know what I mean... looks a lot like curdled milk. I had to keep stirring it to get it to mix, then after a minute or two, I'd have to stir again.I won't reorder this.<text>

<text>Lesser of the two evils
Since I am one of those unlucky few with no job and unable to afford health insurance, there is no way I could pay a doctor and a prescription for the allergy medication that works for me, so I gave Zyrtec a try.My allergies can get pretty nasty.  Last few days I had to hold a handkerchief to my nose nearly full time, as it feels I had an open water faucet.  Of course there are other debilitating symptoms.My problem with Zyrtec is that it makes me pretty sleepy and lethargic.  And what is worse totally congested, like I simply cannot breath out of my nose. Very uncomfortable.  I even talk funny.And that is what brought me here, looking for a 'safe' decongestant which I will not get addicted to or set my heart off to 300 beats per minute.<text>

<text>There are other and BETTER gluten-free pretzels out there...
We have been a gluten free family for many years and have been enjoying the new products that are now continully being introduced.  These pretzels are not nearly as good as the ones by Ener-G Foods (small size bags) or by Glutano (larger, family size bags).  These Wylde pretzels are, as one reviewer already commented, not salty enough - that is, not salty enough for me to feel they qualify as satisfying a pretzel yearning.  These pretzels are also much harder than the others, which I don't find appealing.  That being said, I would highly recommend the Glutano or the Ener-G Foods pretzels over these.  I rated it 2-stars simply for being another gluten free product.<text>

<text>not worth the money
Although I like the fact that they are unscented, these wipes just aren't as good as I expected them to be for the money.  Previously I had purchased the Tushies All-Natural wipes that had a light scent.  Those worked fine.  I thought these would be a good alternative to wipes containing fragrance.  They seem much drier, they have a slight alcohol smell to them, and they just don't seem very absorbent for cleaning messes.  In the future I'll buy Seventh Generation as we have found they work very well.<text>

<text>poor use of stevia
I enjoy the regular guru drink, sweetened with cane sugar.  I also use -- and enjoy -- some stevia-sweetened beverages, but frankly, stevia tastes different than sugar, and can't be used in exactly the same way.  Guru doesn't seem to get this.  The only way i've been able to force myself through an entire case of guru "lite" was by ensuring that every can was ice cold (which improves the flavor slightly, as with most stevia-sweetened drinks).  My recommendation is to stick with the original.<text>

<text>A Total Fiasco!
Lost money, plain and simple. What this product basically do is become solid in the surface of the dentures in which it is applied. Very difficult to calculate or apply in such an even way to where it might be helpful. The whole ceremony of heating up the tube, applying, following all instructions did not seem to pay in the end. Difficult, tedious and not rewarding enough. I do realize that in the new world of dentures and denture users there if a fair amount of people out there with their own particular views. Myself, I bought this item to help my mother and her new dentures so they could fit better, therefore allowing her the possibility of conquering the initial trials denture wearers must endure. Previously I had bought the strips instead of the fixodent, and that was more money tossed away. From the "die hard" reviews pertaining this Cushion Grip Thermoplastic Denture Adhesive, 1-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4) I truly believe this was going to be something exceptionally special and it is not. We had no problems heating the product so it can be dispensed and applying it but in the end it dried out and turned like an alien substance on top of everything else. I am getting a little weary of "die hards" that all they do is praise, praise, praise and always one to give others the benefit of the doubt, I still can not help but to ask myself: "What exactly are they doing that I am not doing myself and why, supposedly, works so great for others but not for us?".  I would be more than glad to send what remains of this product to one of the happy customers that prompted me to purchase it in the first place. No, it is not that I am a dummy and have no understanding on how to read and follow instructions. I am actually pretty good at that. This product is not a miracle cure, that is for sure. Going back to conventional fixodent type product and hope for the best. Too much money spent in such a silly way. Now I love to find a "die hard" of this product and give them the 3 plus tubes. Removing the solution is another fun time on its own. 2 Stars for the wonderful Thermoplastic blah blah blah!<text>

The bottle is lovely and very girlie, I love the amethyst jewel tone of purple. Even tho, I love the bottle, I don't love the fragrance held within. M to me does smell faintly of marshmellows, violets, citronella and cinnamon. It is sweet, but not overtly so. M lies very close to the skin. One would have to get very close to even smell it. There's also something in M that I'm very allergic to. I'm allergic to citronella and I'm sure that M has it listed as an ingredient. It's not my cup of tea, but I'm sure many will love it. <text>

<text>Consult your doctor
This product did work for me; from the very first night of use, my snoring was significantly reduced in volume - to a tolerable level. HOWEVER, one concern a consumer should have is that the "medicine" in this product may cause a "rebound" effect; i.e., if you stop using it, the symptoms may reappear even worse than before.Bottom line: Consult with your doctor.I stopped using the product after a week and went on a doctor prescribed medication that, from a safety (FDA tested) point of view, I'm much more comfortable with; and the price is comparable given my health insurance coverage.<text>

<text>I should have listened
Other reviews have mentioned it, but I refused to believe.  I am unhappy with Amazon for leaving the image up for the old version of this product.  Back then, these things were wonderful.  This new version, boasting "Real Hershey's Chocolate," has a taste pretty similar to the old style.  The texture and density are very different.  They are soft, limp, and a little spongy.  If you close your eyes and chew fast and hard, you can pretend it's the good kind.<text>

<text>Eh...
This is not a strong nor malty tea, the taste is average- nothing particular outstanding or  to applaude. I have not experience the "decaffinated" effects of this tea, although the words do  carry a placebo effect.I have found tea package in America/Canada from Twining do not have same quality as the Twining sold in England:London/Heathrow Airports. Just not the same in terms of the flavour. Very deceiving as it does not indicate on the website as where it has been packaged.<text>

<text>Weird smell, ok flavor.
I tried several of these bars, but I had to hold my breath to take a bite -- they smell terrible! Like vinegar or something. Most unpleasant. The taste isn't bad, but it ain't a chocolate brownie, I don't care what any of the other reviews say! <text>

<text>Severe itching as a side effect
I tried Align, on my doctor's recommendation, in response to a c-difficile issue resulting from multiple antibiotic use, which tends to endanger or diminish the prevalence of 'good bacteria' in the gut.I experienced severe body-wide itching as a response. After stopping it, the itching subsided. When I tried it again, the same itching came back.I switched to Flora-Q, which contains four different ingredients (instead of Align's single bacteria strain), and had excellent results. I also used RisaQuad, a generic equivalent to Flora-Q, also with excellent results.I did report the itching to Align's manufacturer, and got a lackadaisical response. If there are others with the same experience, it can be useful to share that in a forum such as this, so that Align's manufacturers may want to take that seriously. <text>

Unfortunately,this product does not absorb water or other liquids as good as other brands. I end up using more sheets for a single spot,therefore,I finish a roll much faster than if using other brands (Bownty is my brand of choice). And it doesn''t clean as well either. I welcome and support 7th generation products,but this one needs to improve.<text>

<text>Just what the doctor ordered - B-L-A-N-D
Because of tummy troubles, my doctor ordered me on a very bland diet.  Well this stuff is JUST what the doctor ordered, as it is almost completely tasteless.  I can't give it a one star which qualifies as  hating it, as I can't hate anything that has pasta as one of the ingredients, but it is not good.  It makes Kraft Mac and Cheese seem very exciting!  I would not reorder and would fear ordering anything else from Annie's.  This would only be for young children who hate anything with a taste to it.<text>

<text>WoW, I finally found it!
Remember "Raw Bits", that cereal sponsor for the "Prairie Home Companion"?  The one made from "oat hulls and wheat shafts"? By George I think I've found it! YES!!! This is  the number one most crunchy thing on the planet, which is edible. I've not broken a tooth yet, but my ears still ring from eating it. And I tried to like it. At first I thought I liked it. Later I thought I hated it. Then I decided that I was missing the point; "Raw Bits" is not about flavor, it's about commitment, it's about doing the right thing, it's about put up and shut up. Think about your Norwegian Bachelor Farmer ancestors, for gosh sakes! Do you suppose that they whined about their cereal not "tasting good enough"?  Of course not! Eating Heritage O's/Raw Bits gives shy people the courage to get up and do what needs to be done!(Now could someone please help me find those tasty and expeditious "Powder Milk Biscuits"?)<text>

<text>Too Weak; Try "Seattle's Best" Instead
Everyone seems to rave about this coffee, but I found it to be too weak for me. That might be due to personal preference, or perhaps to the amount of grinds in each k-cup. Either way, I now use the Keurig coffee filter that came with the machine, and I use only Seattle's Best, which I have found to be the most flavorful and strongest cup of coffee available for the Keurig system. Their Breakfast Blend, French Roast and Hazelnut are all fabulous.Give them a try &amp; take an extra 30 seconds to use your own grinds in your Keurig machine; you will not be disappointed!!<text>

<text>Tastes like strawberries and dirt
I was excited to find a Dr. REcommended Omega -3 DHA supplement for my toddler. I've tried several times to get him to eat them and he always makes a face and spits them out. I was surprised because my son is not usually picky. I decided to try them. They are sweet like strawberries but gritty like they have sand in them. I don't blame him for not liking them. I'll end up taking them myself and finding another supplement. Sorry Dr. Sears, but this product needs some palatability work. I did appreciate that they were individually wrapped and chewable, just not very tasty.<text>

<text>Didn't work for me, at least not as well as it seemed to for others
I am a 22 year old female and I have had atopic dermatitis (eczema) since I was born. It gets very severe in the cold seasons and this year it has been particularly worse. I purchased this product after reading the rave reviews and eagerly awaited for it to arrive. I took a shower and applied AmLactin when I got out. First of all, it burned like hell. I seriously had to take several minutes to calm down each time I rubbed a little more into my skin. I'm talking about biting-down-on-a-towel-as-hard-as-you-can kind of pain. I thought, "well, this could be a sign it's working maybe" so I finished applying it and put my pajamas on. At first, it seemed to work fairly well. I didn't really have to itch as much as I usually do (it seems the itching is always worse at night when I'm in bed), but after a few hours of sleeping I awoke and found myself itching myself again. I reapplied the cream, clenched my teeth at the burning, and managed to fall back asleep. I wash my sheets regularly with hypo-allergenic detergent, so I know it's like the beds fault. Anyway, after a couple weeks of using this product, I am officially giving up on it. The pain alone is unbearable. I shouldn't have to deal with that every time I use it. And it seemed to make my skin feel "chalky". It didn't FEEL moisturized. It felt dry to the touch and although it did manage to minimize my itching to some extent, it required constant reapplying. Not the product for me and I wouldn't recommend it to someone that has the same symptoms as me. Everyone reacts differently to these types of things, so try it if you're really curious.<text>

<text>Bad Taste (Rating: 5 out of 10- -2.5 stars)
My mom bought this as the alternative to sugar and loves using it all the time in her coffee. Me, I believe it's just okay, but leaves a horrible after taste. I tried using it many times, hoping I would acquire the taste, but it just didn't come at all. It even makes the coffee I drink have a weird after taste as well. Judging by the reviews, people like this stuff, me I just stick to regular sugar or Equal, because it tastes better than the Splenda.<text>

<text>Sinupret - Disappointment
After unsuccessfully searching high and low through my town for Sinupret, I ordered it on Amazon.  My 2 1/2 year old son had nasal congestion and using eucalyptus oil and a humidifier weren't enough. I was excited to get the box but very disappointed to learn that he needed to take it three times a day and that I would have to coordinate with daycare to give him an afternoon dose.  He also did NOT like the taste and he quickly caught on to putting it in applesauce. So, unfortunately I'm not sure how well this product works because I was unable to get my son to take the 3 doses per day for 7-10 days.  I will try again!<text>

Blech!! I have to plug my nose to get this stuff down in the morning.

AWFUL, absolutely awful in comparison to American Whey. I can't wait until she gets it back in stock, so I can ditch this stuff. What a waste of money!!<text>

<text>difference of opinion
Funny how opinions can vary so widely...I bought this coffee based on a few other rave reviews, and have found it to be almost undrinkable.  I have to reduce the size to "espresso shot" to get enough flavor out of this coffee.  I like bold  and strong coffee, and this just didn't do it for me.  I think it pales in comparison to Coffee People's Jet Fuel, or Timothy's Midnight Magic.....<text>

I appreciate the fact that this appears to be a somewhat healthy drink, but I cannot stand the taste.  Perhaps it is because I have acquired a taste for the "Blast" energy drink, but this is just sooooo sweet and somewhat cough-syrupy like another reviewer said.  Perhaps I will acquire a taste for it by the time I finish the case, but I think it will be a bit of torture in the mean time.  I'm sure that it's good for some people, but I doubt that I will ever order it again.<text>

<text>Do you like Beans?
Bob's flour is one of the first mixed GF flours that I tried.  The only problem is that everything I put it into, ended up tasting like beans or lentils.  I tried to thicken soups, tasted like beans...tried to make cake, tasted like beans.  I seriously thought I had some sort of taste bud problem.  I always cut the bag open and poured it into a container, so I couldn't check the ingredient label.  In desperation, I went to the supermarket and looked at the bag.  Sure enough, Bob mixes "GARBANZO BEAN FLOUR" into this mix.  So caution, if you like bean-tasting food, then this is the best flour for you!!  Instead, I'd highly recommend Gluten-Free Pantry's Beth's Flour mix.  It's amazing in both texture and taste, and works as a substitute for any recipe that calls for flour.<text>

<text>Works... but not as well as energy drinks by any means!
I must say I'm kinda disappointed in this gum as I was expecting the same energy spurt that the Monster drinks gave me (as it has the same amount of caffeine, allegedly). I tried to chew 4 pieces (2 supposedly gives you the same amount of caffeine as in an energy drink) and that didn't give me near the amount of energy that a monster does. You do feel a little tingle after chewing 4  pieces but it's more like the feeling you get when you eat a candy bar or drink hot chocolate. I'm guessing that the claims for containing the amount of caffeine is true, but my body isn't absorbing it optimally (If I caffeine pill it - generic caffeine pills from walmart - then I get close to the energy drink energy burst)<text>

<text>Tastes bitter
Mac n Cheese makes a great late night meal, and it's great comfort food. I picked up a couple boxes of the new Organic version, assuming it would taste the same. The first box tasted so bitter that I had to toss it all. I thought maybe I had a bad box, so I gave it another try, but it still tastes disgusting. Has anyone else noticed this?<text>

<text>Not really worth it.
Finally finished using this product. Took 1 month to finish the bottle. I took 2 pills the 1st week and then bumped it up to 3 a day thereafter. I'm starting to see some results. I've had acne all over my back since forever and finally starting to see them getting smaller. I still get those occasional pimples once in awhile however. My take another couple months to see my skin clear up though. One thing I hate is the price since it doesn't last for very long. But I guess if its helping its worth it.Update.Ok, finished off 3 bottles of this stuff. Still was taking 3 a day everyday. I did not notice any helpful benefits by taking this. Still was getting terrible acne on my back. It may have helped somewhat by limiting the number but still not enough to warrent a fourth bottle. I did however combine this with Oxy cleansing pads towards the finishing off the bottle. That seems to be working better than taking pills.<text>

<text>Unfortunately didn't work
I love most of the Seventh Generation products but unfortunately this did not work very well for us.  Left a lot of food on dishes and we had to basically either wash the dishes before putting into dishwasher or run the dishwasher again.  Defeats the purpose.  I'll keep checking back, hopefully Seventh Generation will be able to improve on this.  Scent was great however, not too overpowering.<text>

<text>Was Not Impressed
I seldom if ever give a negative review, but to put it bluntly, this stuff was bad. I tried this product based on its label of "Premium Essence Water", and the flavor sounded good too (Pomegranate-Tangerine). The first thing I noticed before opening the bottle was the amount of debris/particles/sediment floating inside the water while the sun was reflected into the bottle. I decided to still go ahead and try it and was quite unimpressed. The water had a flavor of industrial tap water, the kind you get in a large city, that is processed at the water plant nestled next to the sewer plant. There was a 'hint' of some flavor, though I couldn't pinpoint it. I gave the high 2-star rating because it would probably still be effective at dousing a fire.<text>

This eye mask is not very soft and the strap that holds it in place is uncomfortable.  I have to wear the strap a bit loose so the mask eventually falls off.  When it is in place, it does keep the room nice and dark but I would not recommend this item.<text>

<text>Not all of the mix comes out!
What's the point?  Without the full content of the mix the hot chocolate comes out watery.  I've tried a few different water settings.  I'm not sure whose at fault: Gloria Jean's products for not allowing all of the mix to be brewed? Or the Keurig Brewing System for not pushing enough water through to clear the k-cup?  In any event, I have to poke a hole in the k-cup and empty out the rest of the powder to get the full effect, which is still kind of watery.  I like Green Mountain Hot Cocoa K-Cups for Keurig Brewer, 16 ct.  Their hot cocoa tastes stronger, but to be fair, I have the same issue as I do with Gloria Jean's: not all of the mix comes out. I prefer to use the Brewing System for hot water and go the old fashion route using packets of hot chocolate... it's cheaper and better! <text>

<text>It works a little....
I must admit that I was anxious to try this.  Sure sounded interesting because as we all know, sometimes an encounter can leave you feeling very unfulfilled...  The first time I tried the product, I just kept applying it until I felt something.  It took ~5 drops.  Ok, so I learned that it takes a few (10 +/- minutes to feel the sensation it causes).  Then it took a shower and a half-hour or so to completely wear off.  The sensation it gives is like cinnamon oil....not a tingle, and for me, didn't heighten overall sensitivity at all.  Because it is to be applied ONLY externally (clitoris) and not other places, it depends on what you like....The second time I used this product, I ended up applying three drops.  This makes the product rather pricey because this container only holds about 20 drops...  I can't highly recommend it, and I probably won't buy this again, but it was a fun experiment.<text>

<text>Chalk in a Can
    I realize that protein powders never usually taste like anything, but this stuff is horrible!  Smells like strawberry, tastes like chalk.  I can put 2 whole bananas in my shake, and it still tastes bad.  I normally drink one upon waking, and within 1-2 hours, I am sick to my stomach.  I found that eating with my shake was the only way to avoid this.  On the other hand, this powder mixes well, and it does smell good.  SMELL good.  I find that 3 scoops in 10 oz of milk mixes well enough, if only it would taste like something.  I will go back to Labrada, at least chocolate tastes like chocolate with them.  Oh, and good luck finding the scooper.  Mine is always in the bottom of the can.  <text>

While the flavor is good and keeps breath fresh as well as a lozenge does, the brush is not easy to handle (it is so small) and there is no bristle height to be effective.  The pick does not get completely between teeth, as it is too thick.  The foil packaging is difficult to open. <text>

I love using the K-Cup for hot or iced tea, so I was excited by this flavor.  But, I hardly use it, since even on the lowest temp setting, this comes out way too bitter.  Besides that, I like the light balance of flavor otherwise.  It just isn't enjoyable with the bitterness.<text>

Like all bob's red mill mixes this tastes strongly of beans.The cake looked great and unlike most GF mixes this bag made a two layer cake, lovely, but the smell of the batter and the taste of the finished cake was AWFUL.

<text>Tastes okay I guess, odd flavor/texture
Besides the color and texture which was so off-putting that I almost couldn't make myself try it, they were edible..at first.  Their nutritional value isn't that great:  ~Way too high of fat (18g as it stated on BAR, 16g stated on website)~High Carbs (30) ~Too much sugar (10g)~Little vitamin value/low fiber~the only redeeming quality is 9g of protein.  These bars are slimy and thick textured like pulverized grass mixed with oil.  They are very oily.  After the first one I couldn't make myself eat another so that was it for me.  I won't repurchase or buy any other flavor.<text>

I didn't think the taste was bad overall, just didn't like the waxy feeling. I will finish the box, but I doubt I'll buy it again. I guess that's what I get for trying to eat chocolate for breakfast! <text>

<text>Not for heavy leakers with big breasts
I tried both the Johnson's and Lansinoh disposable pads, and I definitely prefer the Lansinoh. Here is why:- the Johnson's are smaller, but thicker. I have large breasts, and they just about cover my areolae. When they shift (and they do, I tend to toss and turn at night), they'll easily slide off the nipple. Result: soaked bed. The sticky part isn't very sticky. Neither is Lansinoh's, but at least they're big enough so that the nipple is still covered, even if they do slide. -The Johnson's don't wick away the moisture very well. I've leaked through them at night, but part of the edge was still dry. I've only leaked through the Lansinoh's when the pad was completely saturated, and they may look thinner, but they can take up a lot more than the Johnson's can.-With the Johnson's, the side that is not supposed to stick sometimes sticks to my nipple! This happens during the day, when I'm not leaking. Annoying, especially if your nipples are already sensitive and recovering from cracks.Overall, I think they might do the job and even be comfortable if you have smaller breasts and less leakage than I do, but for me they're not doing the trick.<text>

<text>Opt for the Pro-X or Regenerist Line ...
Procter and Gamble has always been honest about their Olay line: it doesn't provide surgical results and it doesn't even take the place of a visit to the dermatologist ... but it does allow for small, positive changes.Though this product is inexpensive, I agree with the opinion of some other reviewers ... it's a little gimmicky. You would be better off to invest in the Olay Anti-Aging Starter Protocol Pro-X Kit which is a bit more intensive and offers better results. This will make your skin softer, but there were no other noticeable results (for me). (But I also do not smoke, do not drink, have a strict diet, and wear SPF every day ... someone who needs genuine repair may see other results). My personal opinion is that instead of experimenting with the product du jour, men/women interested in skincare should book an appointment with the dermatologist and get a professional opinion. My dermatologist customizes programs for her clients' specific needs ... you simply cannot do this in the aisles of Wal-Mart. The bad part is that the expense doesn't stop here. You'll probably be given a prescription for Renova (which is about $200.00) and be told to invest in a moisturizer (about $15.00-$35.00) and an SPF lotion/foundation (price varies). So, if you are always experimenting with  the newest product and dropping $30 here, $40 there ... then just see a dermatologist. If you do not expect significant results and will be pleased with small changes, then try some of the Pro-X or Regenerist products. Bottom line: While Olay's Skin Rehab isn't going to inspire drastic changes, it will leave your skin feeling softer. The price is appealing, but there are only two weeks worth of product included.<text>

<text>Still Too Heavy for Fine Hair
I have fine, naturally curly hair that tends to frizz on the sides. I've tried many products for curly hair and often find that they either leave my hair too crunchy or they are just too heavy for fine hair. I wanted to like Bb Curl Conscious, but it really didn't do anything but make my curls heavy and too soft to hold a style, and did nothing to smooth out the frizz. So I'm going to pass on this one. BUT...My hairdresser recommended Moroccan Oil Curling Creme and that is what I use now. It controls the frizz better than anything I've used so far, and the argan oil actually adds body to my hair and my curls look *pretty* not just curly.  It also smells fabulous without competing with my perfume. <text>

<text>Bad reaction
I had a bad reaction to this product, I noticed right away that my arm pits were itching, I didn't put it togeather right away so three days later after sweating a bit it had become really bad. I went to the bathroom and washed off and the skin came off the underside of my armpit, and it burned badly. I didn't get a rash, but it felt like I had been rubbed with acid, it was bad, I threw the stick away. I have used the Polo Blue stick of similar make with no issues, as well the Yves St. Lauren stick was fine. I attempted to inspect the label and see if I could find anything but I have never had a reaction to anything else like this before, so watch out! I gave it 2 stars because it smelled good, but damn.<text>

I thought I would try them again (hoping they had improved)with our baby boy and am very disappointed again.  I'm kind of a clean freak and the brownish orange stains on the onsies are really dingy looking.  We ran out of onsies a few weeks ago and put him to bed with just the sleeper over his diaper and it is RUINED!  I have soaked it for days in Oxi Clean washed it eight times and is still not coming out.   As far as leaks go they don't work overnight. <text>

This model proved to be erratic, responding to incidental room noises sometimes, but at other times ignoring distinctive claps.  It does provide some entertainment value, but can be disruptive at night and at other times simply annoying.  The sensitivity control seems operative, but doesn't make the operation any more predictable. <text>

<text>INCONSISTENT Great to Horrible!
I reviewed this licorice several months ago and gave it 5 stars. I deleted that old review because of extreme inconsistencies in this product. When it is good it is beyond 5 stars. I loved it so much I even preferred it over RJ's. I had a case a month auto delivered to get the discount. For several months it was the perfect licorice but the last case I received last week was HORRIBLE!!! It seriously tasted just like the smell of Preparation-H ointment! I wrote to the company to tell them about this and gave them the control numbers off the case. I am trying to get a refund from Amazon as well. Until they get this quality control issue fixed I am going back to RJ's. While RJ's tends to be very inconsistent in texture from firm to very soft, the flavor has always been close to the same. I still like Darrell Lea better when it is well, normal. The Line No. on the case was 07-938 Exp. Jan. 27 2010, if that helps. Licorice must be very difficult to make, guess thats why there are no recipes out there at all!<text>

<text>Only ONE use?!
I purchased this product at a PureBeauty store before reading all the reviews on it (it came recomended from a store employee because it "smelled better than most dry shampoos.").  It did work great the ONE time I was used it.  After that use it seemed like there was still a lot of product in the can, but when I went to use it again a week later there was nothing left at all.  Terribly disappointing and frustrating.  And unfortunately when I brought it back to PureBeauty and complained about it they simply said they don't accept any returns on empty products.  Argh!!!  Simply put: don't buy this unless you want that one use is worth $18.95 to you.  That's the last time I'm buying from Tigi!<text>

<text>Mixed Feelings
This is an attractive machine, looks good in my kitchen.  My husband and I use different coffees and love the convenience of having whatever brew we need available, cup by cup.  It's easy to operate, the coffee smells good and tastes good.  Having said that, here's the downside.  It's not very well made.  It has been recalled for some electrical difficulty that could have been disastrous and the replacement broke down within months.  I am now on my fourth or fifth one and if this one goes bad in the next two years or so I am going shopping for another brand.  Sometimes I think I keep buying them just because it's so fast, efficient and pleasant to deal with Amazon.<text>

<text>weak cappuccino
This is the first Douwe Egberts coffee product I am not satisfied with. It has a nice froth but it is very weak. I like coffee that has a strong coffee essence but this pod offers only a weak coffee flavor. What I had to do for a good coffee taste was to add a half teaspoon of instant coffee to the cup before starting the brew cycle. These pods need to be improved before I will buy them again.<text>

<text>Bitter to the End
Silly me, thought with the name it would at least have the aroma of kahlua coffee.  Far from that.  This coffee is extremely bitter, doesn't taste like kahlua or have the aroma.  Somewhat strong. Sroma of arabic beans.  Won't buy again.<text>

<text>Skip the Body Gel...
I was pretty disappointed by this product.  I love the fragrance (I already had the perfume), but this gel dries into the skin instantly , and doesn't moisturize at all, and the fragrance fades within about a half hour.  I probably should have gone for the lotion or body cream.  Live and learn  :-/<text>

<text>Doesn't lather well and left hair feeling dry.
I feel like I need to use a lot of this product to get it to lather even a little bit. After one washing with it, I feel like my hair is still dirty. The other reviewers made it sound like it was more of a moisturizing shampoo, which is what I was looking for, and much to my disappointment, it doesn't seem to be. The one plus, it smells very nice. Just wish it performed better.<text>

<text>chemical overload
The hospital used these (Swaddlers Sensitive) on our newborn, and the nifty yellow-blue line that indicates wet or dry feature was great for us new parents.  They proved hard to find in stores, however, and it was a few months before we found them again on Amazon.  Excited as we were, out of the box, we noticed a distinct odor that was more chemical than baby powder. As time went on, it became clear that the odor was not just strong, it also caused our baby to rub her eyes, squirm when wearing them, and generally resist the diaper altogether.  We too became somewhat overpowered and repelled by the scent.  I'm a few too many diapers into the box to feel like I can justifiably return them, but I would do so, if only to send the message to Proctor &amp; Gamble.  These have made me rethink cloth diapers as a better way.   If you have a dead nose, they work brilliantly at keeping baby dry (hence the 2 stars).  But I feel that in this case, the odor could well be attributed to something less than healthy. So use with caution. <text>

<text>Anything more than a small cup is just brown water
I drink Coffee People Donut Shop just about every morning because it tastes like what I think morning coffee should taste like.  Maybe I don't have a refined enough palate for this, but to me it has such a mild taste that I might as well start my day with tea.  Not that anything is wrong with tea (when I can't get coffee) but when I drink coffee I want to taste coffee not the "subtle hint of citrus", or "berry tones".  If you like coffee skip it.  If you take notes when you taste things this may be for you.<text>

<text>squeak squeak squeak
I bought these in hopes of extending the life of my New Balance 993 shoes.  The inserts were a perfect fit for my extra-wide shoes and, after some adjusting, they became fairly stationary (though they do move around more than the factory insoles.) Comfort was fine- about the same as the factory insoles.  Based on their current wear levels after 6 weeks, I'd expect them to last at least several months- comparable to the factory insoles.  The problem with these insoles is that they've developed a bit of a squeak.  As I walk down the hall, every step on my left heal results in a pronounced squeak.  It's funny and embarrassing at the same time.  Because of this squeak and how quickly it developed, I have to recommend that you not buy this product unless you plan to change them out every 4 weeks or so.<text>

<text>Not What I Expected
I was very disappointed in the taste of this item.  Not at all what I expected from Splenda.  It is much too overpowering, strong and when added to your beverage, that is all you can taste.  For instance, if added to coffee, you will not detect ANY coffee flavor, only the Splenda flavor.  Much too strong.  I prefer the subtle taste of the other coffee additives over this Splenda product - without question!!<text>

<text>If it stings and burn throw it in the trash
Age:23Skin Type: brown skin, moderately oily in the summer.When I was a teen(age:17), I used this product and it miraculously cleared up my acne and pimple with in two weeks with no dryness, redness, or burning like proactive, which I have also tried. Now that I am an adult(age:23) I have begun to get really stressful(unbalance hormones) and developed some really extreme acne, from nodules(large hard pumps under skin) to pustules(an inflamed whitehead). I thought eh what the heck, if it worked in the past it will work now. Was I regrettably wrong.  The first time I tried it again, my face was burning and red, but I thought to myself it was just my skin getting used to the Bp(benzoyl peroxide) and I was desperate. The burning subsided after a few days, but then my skin started to get flaky mainly in the ares when I'd applied the bp lotion. I was happy that it calmed down the bumps, but after a day, more bumps and whiteheads were appearing in the healed area due to irritation. I told myself it was the purging period. It was the longest purging period ever--3 weeks. I was depressed, I didn't even wanted to go out anymore, and even when I did, I try not to make eye contact and just look down the whole time. After a month and a half of using this product I still have some minor nodules and a few white heads, but worse of all I have these reddish-brown unhealed dark spot cause by Bp( did my research)--I hope it isn't permanent darkspots.My conclusion for this product is that the ingredients changed. I have compared the old regime to the new regime and the old regime feels more safe on the skin then the new ones. And Bp is toxic for your skin, specifically my skin.Now I am trying to find a more natural alternative like tea tree oil cleanser,alcohol free toner, etc.. and you don't need a moisturizer when your cleanser and toner are natural(safe) and doesn't leave your skin dry.Hope this review help and good luck with the battle against acne.   <text>

<text>Back to the drawing board
I just received them today and since it's made by Colgate I'm disappointed in their design. I use EVERY variation of Colgate Total and Tom's of Maine toothpastes. Normally I use an electric toothbrush, but when traveling to somewhere where luggage can get lost I use an Oral B soft toothbrush and keep one of those crummy hard bristled folding travel toothbrushes in my purse. I thought this item would be PERFECT, but alas it's not. While I love the idea and that they are individually wrapped and disposable (I know not very green) I would not use them again. If the manufacturer's designers are reading, here are my suggestions to regain my use of this product: lengthen the handle by an inch but keep same style and diameter; USE SOFT BRISTLES (a lot of us already have sensitive teeth due to gum recession); use a slightly dehydrated bead/blob of Colgate Total Whitening toothpaste (knowing that as Americans we will be expectorating no matter which "waterless" cleaning agent you use) so provide the type you already know your customers like to use; lastly make wintergreen flavor available. This creation has the potential to be a very hot product if those few modifications were considered and implemented. <text>

<text>Love the cereal... don't buy from Amazon
I bought the Kashi GOLEAN cereal from Amazon because I couldn't find it at my local grocery store the last time I went...I really like the cereal, it was the packaging for shipping that is getting the bad review:The boxes were all taped together with packing tape, and the tape ran accross the top of all of the boxes, rendering the resealable closing tab on the top of the box useless, as it basically had to be ripped off to get the tape off of the top of the boxes.  The same thing happened along the sides, now I have 6 boxes of Kashi with half of the box ripped and destroyed, including the nutrition facts on the side.<text>

Saw this product online, looked over the reviews seemed favorable. I found this product to be extremely sweet; its main ingredient is sugar, it states that  right on the label.

<text>Dried Out My Skin
I have used this product for a little over two weeks and so far the results have been terrible. I did the entire system and followed the directions exactly yet after every wash my skin was dried out and stripped of it natural oils. I now have dry patches on my cheeks and chin and I still have acne on my forhead. I tought maybe it was the acne control lotiona that was the problem so I reduced my usage but the cleanser is just as bad, after washing my face and putting on moisturizer the dry patches did not subside. Do NOT waste your money, I am a young African American female with combination skin so I suggest for people in the same boat as I am to look elsewhere. <text>

<text>Yuck...
I have long hair and had high hopes for a miracle when I bought this product.  I was looking for something that would smooth out my crazy frizzies and make my hair look more sleek.  Maybe it's just me, but I followed the instructions on the bottle and something went very wrong.  My hair became sticky and I could barely pull my brush through without extreme pain.  The lotion did make my hair a little less frizzy, but I was expecting dramatic results for product that is popular and much more costly than other brands.  I used up quite a bit of the product trying to acheive the results that were advertised.   Unfortunately it never happened.  It may work on different types of hair though.  <text>

Their spice tea is usually very good and fresh, however, my most recent shipment is probably not very fresh.  In a previous shipment of teabags, I noticed that each teabag would quickly flavor a cup and a half of tea, whereas in the shipment I recently received, a bag will barely flavor one cup, and by the time it is well flavored, the tea is cold.<text>

<text>I've come around...
My boyfriend loves this perfume so I picked some up. At first I didn't like it, at all, but I've come around. I wear it for him because he's so crazy about it and I haven't found anything else he likes as much. SO I've gotten used to it. We've decided it smells like Jolly Ranchers, possibly watermelon. I may have to buy some Jolly Ranchers to confirm this. Sugary sweet undertones. At first it seemed to last forever but now that I'm used to it I realize it does fade from almost overpowering to barely noticeable within an hour or two. Either way he compares himself to Pepe Le Pew when I wear it so it's well worth it. I like Lavanila Vanila Coconut, Lollia Wish, Flores de Iles Floral Sensual, Burberry Brit and Angel for comparison sake. <text>

<text>Unique Flavor, 140 calories, Dubious Nutritional Value
This drink has a unique flavor: closest resemblance I can give is coconut water with pineapple juice. Personally, neither me nor my son, liked the taste.Each 11 oz drink Tetra Pak has 140 calories! Although they claim health benefits for upset stomach, sore throat, acne, eczema and fortification of immune system, I could not easily find any scientific studies to support those claims for this drink or cashew juice. Added sugar cane is not healthy; and you will flush those added vitamins down the toilet, anyway, if you consume healthy diet.O.N.E. juices are produced in Brazil and they claim that their Tetra Paks are environmentally friendly. It is also very confusing as to how to sip it. There is an opening for a straw but is not accompnied by one; of course, plastic straws are not eco-friendly. Sipping directly from the container is not easy.After water, the most healthy drink is vegetable juice. Fruit juices have lot of calories but many  provide unique nutritious ingredients and anti-oxidants- pomegranate, blue berry, mango, carrot etc. I usually dilute fruit juices with club soda, often 1 part juice with 2 parts club soda.I got this drink as a part of Amazon Vine program and would not buy it personally.<text>

This has an artificial-sweetener aftertaste.  It also seems to have an alcohol-like flavor, as if I am adding an alcohol based axtract instead of something made with water.  I have yet to try my strawberry and orange of the same brand, but the chocolate is definitely not worth trying to save money by purchasing this brand (go for sweetleaf, it doesn't taste like a 'diet' sweetener).<text>

Just read the review about the change of ownership!  Now I know why my new 33.8 supply of Hydrate shampoo has changed from the last and is no longer great.  Scent is missing; shampoo is thicker and lighter in color, and it leaves my hair too soft, limp and difficult to manage.  Never again will I buy this product! Why do large corporations always ruin a good thing?<text>

<text>No comparison to Coffee Peoples Donut Shop k-cups
This blend is way to weak. To me it tastes watered down and just can't satisfy that first cup of coffee fix I need in the morning. Coffee peoples Donut Shop does the trick and really is a lot more reminiscent of the old time doughnut shop coffee places. Even Timothy's breakfast blend coffee is better than this.<text>

<text>a friend's review
This was a gift for a friend. To protect the identity of her wrinkles, the friend shall remain nameless. When I asked about how she liked the "roller", she was not particular enthused. The biggest complaint that she had is the application of the roller. According to my friend, she felt the need to "press the roller down really hard to get anything out". Given the sensitive nature of application site, she reported she would rather use a traditional cream or serum by hand, rather than "poking her eyes with a glue stick". I asked her if the thing at least worked in the "anti-aging" department. She retorted with a "what do you think?". Luckily, I choked back on the immediate response of "looks the same to me" and commented on her youthful complexion. I would say this product is a bust. Too much trouble for very little gain. <text>

After using French Vanilla creamer in other coffees, I made the jump to French Vanilla coffee.  What a mistake.  Definitely not the same.  Not even close.

<text>Are your contacts giving you problems? Maybe it's the Opti-Free!
I have worn contacts for almost 20 years with no problems and have always been very thorough in my cleaning regime. I've been through permanent lenses, monthly disposables and weekly disposables and they've always lasted for the proper duration. Right now I wear Acuvue Oasis which I found to be very comfortable and which are designed to be replaced every 2 weeks.Over the past year, however, I've been finding that more often than not they will gunk up with a cloudy slime well before the 2 weeks is up, sometimes after only a couple of days of wear. Worse still, the gunk is often impossible to clean off even though I use a good cleaning fluid and protein removing drops. It seems that no amount of rubbing and rinsing will suffice. Amazingly, I never considered that it might be Opti-Free Replenish that was the culprit because I always thought of it as an excellent solution and it was recommended to me both by my optician and online reviews as a good choice to use with Acuvue Oasis. However, it's just recently dawned on me that the gunk-from-hell might be a product of an allergic reaction to Replenish. So I've switched to Renu Sensitive Eyes, which is NOT a "no rub" solution and does NOT contain inbuilt protein removal (I rub with a cleaning fluid and provide my own protein removal) - and hey presto, my lenses are lasting the full 2 weeks again. No gunk! I have no idea what my eyes were reacting to but I have a hunch that it may have been either the no-rub ingredient or the protein removing ingredient. So if you're having problems with your eyes or your lenses and you use Replenish, make sure you try another solution to see if it's the culprit! It seems that people are having more problems with this solution than most others on the market. Also, I have not noticed any reduction in moisture or comfort after switching to Renu, which means I wasn't really getting much benefit from the moisturizers in Replenish anyway, which was pretty much the whole point in using that solution. <text>

<text>I agree with the previous reviewer, the name is deceptive.
When one purchases a product that is called Newman's Organics, one would expect organic food.  Not just the vegetables, which are much less expensive to be organic than the meat or chicken.  I was very, very disappointed to find out that the chicken is not organic.  For a couple of dollars more, just buy real organic dog food. This dog food isn't exactly cheap, so you expect that they will provide what they are advertising.  This whole "greenwashing" thing needs to be regulated better.  If someone uses the word organic in their description, it better be organic.  Otherwise the consumer is being deceived which is unfortunate.  Newmans has a great reputation, I buy a lot of their products, but this was intentionally deceptive and it makes me reconsider buying anything from them in the future.On the positive side, my dog loved it, she would lick the bowl around the room for 20 minutes after the last morsel was consumed.  I have no idea what they put in it that tasted so good, it's like the crack cocaine of dog food.  She has never been a finicky eater, she'll pretty much eat anything voraciously, but this stuff really rocked her epicurean world.  Too bad she isn't getting any more of it.<text>

Based on the reviews here, I had high hopes for this coffee.  I realize it's a mild coffee, but it is really lacking taste and just seems very watery.  I tried making a smaller cup, which did help a little, but I'm still disappointed.  I won't be purchasing this one again.  I wonder if this is typical of Gevalia t-discs, cause I was disappointed in the Gevalia Capp as well (the Maxwell House is WAY better).<text>

This product did supress my appetite quite a few times. It mostly helped when I would go to resturants or eat fast food. I found that I became fuller faster than usual. On a day to day basis it did help only a little bit. I eat very healthy to begin with and exercise 6 times a week. This product did not help with my weight loss nor did I feel like it gave me any added energy. <text>

<text>Not quite as good as I recall.
I first tried Royall Bay Rhum about 40 years ago when I bought a bottle in the USVI. I really enjoyed its understated scent which I guess one could call "manly".Perhaps it's just my memory, but I seem to recall the scent being quite a bit stronger and certainly a lot longer lasting. I still like the scent but find myself using it a lot more liberally than I do most colognes. By the way, I consider this to be more of an after shave than a cologne.While it's not the most expensive cologne/after shave I've ever used, I think that it's expensive enough that it should be longer lasting or at least a lot stronger. As it is, I think that it's been cut with a lot of alcohol to stretch the more expensive ingredients. To put it bluntly, I find this product overpriced.I'll probably use Bay Rhum again but it will not be Royall.<text>

<text>Review of Prevagen for memory loss
I have just completed 30 days of Prevagen and have thus emptied the bottle.  I am sorry to say that the product was completely and utterly ineffective.  So ineffective I cannot even remember the reasons why I was persuaded that it would work.  My short term memory is just as bad if not worse than when I started.  I did not expect that it would cure my memory problem completely but I did expect some good benefit.  Consequently, I'm really disapointed.There was no way to rate this item on your scale but from my review it should be obvious.  I'm not sure why Amazon says I rate it a 2.  I hope either the product or my review helps someone else.\<text>

<text>Poor Conditioner
I've tried many conditioners over the years. I thought the Terax Crema would be something special based on all the glowing reviews and company claims. I found none to be true. My hair actually started to become poorly textured and somewhat tangly while using this conditioner. It barely conditions. It certainly doesn't improve hair texture or condition. It smells nice- that's about the only positive thing that I can say about it.  Many better conditioners out there, cheap and pricey.<text>

My container arrived with not one, but BOTH, of the tabs on the top lid broken off (and therefore almost impossible to open).

They said that they'd send me one, but instead sent me a new freezer thing.  When I tried to contact them about their error, they never responded.  By the time I was done waiting for them, it was too late to return to amazon.<text>

I really like lip balm pots, so I decided to give this one a try.  The smell was so terrible that I ended throwing this lip balm away.

They have one that comes in a blue pot and I might give that one a try.  I don't see how anyone could have gave this a positive review.  It might be a good lip balm but the smell was nauseating.<text>

<text>Poor charge, must've gotten a bad batch
With all the positive reviews, I must've just gotten unlucky on a bad batch of the white wrapper version.  I'm getting 1800-2100 mAh on all four of my batteries even after 2 full Refresh cycles on my LaCrosse charger.  This is obviously well below the stated "minimum 2500 mAh" on the batteries.  I love Sanyo normally and I'll continue to buy their Eneloop series, but as of October 5, there's at least a small chance of receiving a bad batch of these batteries.<text>

<text>This stuff killed my stomach
I ran out of my TwinLabs Creatine Mono about a week ago, and decided to try this version, which has more supplements added to it, instead of reordering the 'plain' creatine.  I've taken Creatine several times, and never experienced the bloat that other have complained about - until now.  The bloat I've had for the last 5 days on this stuff is awful, and no matter how much water I drink, juice I take it with, or food I eat with it, the gas is unbearable.  My flat stomach is temporarily gone and I have been spending way too much time in the bathroom.  I have not been able to get a good ab work out in because of the discomfort (I usually work them really hard, but have not been able to push it as far on this stuff).  I am taking the reccomended dosage, so it's not a matter of taking too much of it.  I realize that this may not happen to everyone, but this stuff does not work well for me.

<text>Puffy eyes + Metal rollers = OUCH!
This looks like a great idea. You massage your puffy eyes with the little roller balls and the puffiness goes away. Unfortunately, for me, it didn't work that way. You click on the end a couple of times until the product comes out and then massage your eyes. OK, so I try the right eye first, massaging the puffiness under it. After about 5 seconds, the eye is darker and sore. Well, maybe I rubbed too hard??? So I try the left eye, rubbing extremely gently. No go, the left eye gets sore after 5 seconds as well. No reduction in puffiness for either eye.So I try the next day. This time I put the product on my finger and apply it that way. It's a nice light goo that absorbs in a couple of minutes. Still no reduction in pufffiness. It says to rub all around the eyes, so I massage the crows feet. That's better, but they don't lighten up at all. The rollerballs do not dispense the product evenly and some gets in my eye at this point. It stings. It must be good for something. So I massage my eyebrows into place. Feels good. Doesn't hold them for more than a minute, but it feels good. Then I get wild, I rub the pen on my forehead. Ahh... that would be great for a tension headache. After about 15 seconds of gentle rubbing, my forehead is red. The fine lines are still there. This product did nothing for me, but I gave it 2 stars for the forehead massage. <text>

<text>Probably Not Worth Trying?
Love the White Mountain Hot Chocolate, but I wanted to try something different and while the flavor wasn't horrible, bad it was a bit too sweet and watered down so you lose the heat of the chocolate you're looking for to begin with.Overall the White Mountain is much better.The worst thing though was of all the K-Cups I've used this is the only one that dripped (and not just the occasional cup, many of the two boxes I used) when I would removed it from the Keurig, creating a nice counter mess.  Not happy with this result.It could just have been a bad batch, though since I wasn't happy enough with the flavor I won't be trying this product again to find out.<text>

<text>Offensive smell and not appealing to kids
While I personally love and eat tons of organic and natural foods, I have to say the $30 I spent on this case of cookies was a waster.  Neither of my children will eat them, nor will I.  They have a smell that once you get in your nose hinders any attempt at enjoying the very small bit of flavor they have.  Nature's Path makes great cereal and energy bars but fall short with these cookies.  Stick with the chocolate or peanut butter and you are okay.  The honey grahams will sit in your cupboard until trash day.<text>

<text>Gloria Jean's K-cup Variety Pack
The variety is nice, but the flavors and aromas are so weak that you don't even realize that you are drinking 'flavored' coffee....no less coffee.  I prefer a medium roast coffee, but these do not even come close.  The only way that I would recommend this coffee is if someone prefers a very, very weak cup of coffee. Green Mountain, Newman's Own, and Timothy's brands are much better coffees. As for how many K-cups were actually in the box, I didn't count them.<text>

<text>Despite what O.N.E. claims, I still prefer orange juice.
According to O.N.E., this juice is less acidic than orange juice. After trying it, I must say that my impression is the contrary. Also, this product tastes as if it's artificially sweetened, despite the benign-looking ingredient list. And - just for those curious - no, this drink does NOT have any bit of "cashew nut" favor. All in all, it is a decent drink but certainly not tempting enough for me to buy it in the future.<text>

<text>An Energy Boost But a Bad Taste
Yes, I could tell that this product did give an energy boost, much like a cup of coffee caffeine boost, but the taste is just like trying to chew up a children's chewable vitamin. I thought it might just be me with a problem with the taste, so I gave a couple of the chews to my husband and told them they were chewy candy, like Starbursts. He popped a couple in his mouth, made a terrible face and said "Yuck". It's not that it is really bad, it just is not a pleasant taste. They are very sweet but with a lingering vitamin flavor left in the mouth, so I would not buy these again. Like I said, the energy boost thing is really there(at least it seemed to work), but I just couldn't get past the taste.<text>

<text>Not much flavor, and kind of waxy
I usually love all things cashew and agave, but this bar was a let down. I bought it because all the peanut butter bars are no where to be found due to contamination scares. The one good thing about the bar is that it's not very sweet. Otherwise, I wouldn't get these again. Of the ingredients: Cashew, Date, Agave Nectar, Almond, Amaranth, Sprouted Flax. (Certified Organic, I was only able to taste the flax and amaranth. It didn't have almond flavor or cashew flavor. Raw is supposed to be better, and most of the raw things I've tried have tasted fantastic. This wasn't the case with this bar. <text>

<text>good idea but....
Hormel has came up with another shelf stable product. Of course to make it last over a year on the shelf it has to have lots of preservitive ingredients. I sampled one and found they are very salty and tastless. I bought these thinking they would sell in my little store (I sell mostly to senior citizens) being convienant for Senior Citizens to prepare a quick dinner. I was wrong. They are still on the shelf, and I will probably wind up trying to get rid of them at a loss or give away.<text>

<text>Big price, small change...
I'll keep this sweet and short.Over the course of applying it around my eyes for about a week, there was little change. Only a few very fine lines seem to have disappeared but not enough to be noticed by anyone.I have really sensitive skin, so I was happy that it didn't break me out in a horrible rash.The ball bearings that are on the tip stay cool as you roll/massage the anti-aging lotion in, which might be the only useful thing about this product (a cool ball bearing massage).For the price, totally not worth it. The .2 (a fifth of an ounce) of lotion for nearly $20... just crazy!Pros:Feels good on your skin.Won't break you out (at least I didn't).Cons:Very small amount in the roller tube.Crazy expensive, can't justify the cost for as little the results were/are.<text>

<text>The recipe clearly has way too little liquid
I was excited to try the pre-made cornbread mix.  However, when I made it using the recipe on the back of the packaging, there seemed to be WAY too little liquid.  I could barely get them into the muffin pan, and then they just held their shape (didn't spread into the pan).  It seemed to have a decent taste, aside from being dry.  So I tried it again using a different recipe, and substituting the mix for the flour in the other recipe.  That didn't work perfectly either.  I have had much better results just doing it with a recipe and cornmeal. <text>

<text>Caramel nut?
I, like a few reviews I read after getting it, agree it doesn't taste like caramel vanilla nut. It sort of tastes like ameretto to me or smelled like it, I forget which exactly. I had to add a caramel flavored creamer to it to make it taste more like caramel. I usually hide my coffee's, so no one else uses them all, but I couldn't get anyone to drink more than one pod of this. So I had to muscle through the bulk of these 48 pods myself. It wasn't my fancy, but that doesn't mean you won't like it. Chances are not in your favor IMHO. <text>

<text>Great for the Environment...but just okay for your dishes
Over the last few years I have become increasingly concerned about my impact on the environment.  I use compact fluorescent light bulbs, recycle at least half my trash, try not to drive very much, and buy eco-friendly products.  This is one of the products I have purchased to replace Cascade Complete Gel Lemon Burst - 45 Oz, 12 Ea which I had been using for the last 15 years.  I really assumed this would be an equal, or close to equal, trade considering the higher price... no such luck, unfortunately.I found that this cleaner left food stains on the dishes and silverware, which I normally was able to clean with Cascade.  I also found that harsher stains such as coffee rings in mugs were left untouched after even two washes.  I have recently started pre-scrubbing all the dishes and the silverware before washing.  This resolves almost all of the problems, but at a cost.  If you were unable to scrub dishes, due to arthritis or didn't have time due to a busy schedule, then this would be really annoying.  Plus for those of us that use multiple washes to counter the ineffectiveness, the impact on the environment may be neutralized since we would be wasting more water, more electricity, more gel, etc.  If you have a high efficiency dishwasher and don't mind supplying some essential elbow grease, then I would say this product does help the environment and can eventually clean your dishes.  On the other hand if you are looking for a great automatic dishwasher gel, then keep looking.  This product ranks similar to the cheapest watered-down generics lurking in the sale aisle of a dollar store.  Nothing against this product's intentions, I commend them.  But, its performance left my dishes wondering when Cascade was coming back.<text>

I like the taste of flax seed and often use ground flax seed in my recipes, but now I know that flax seed oil is completely different.

Fortunately, I had purchased it (via Amazon) from Swanson, and they stood my their money-back guarantee.  <text>

<text>Peach Tea
We found very little peach flavor in this "peach tea".  It is a poor substitute for Twinings. <text>

<text>Disappointed
I have used this product for quite some time and always purchased it at department stores.  When I saw it on Amazon for half the usual price I quickly ordered it.  However, when I used it for the first time it did not smell like the product I had been getting and the aroma was weak.  I will not purchase it here again.<text>

<text>TOO WEAK OF A SCENT!  DISAPPOINTED BY LACOSTE
THIS FRAGRANCE WAS PURCHASED BY ME AND FOR MYSELF TO USE, HOWEVER THIS SPECIFIC LACOSTE RED FRAGRANCE LET ME DOWN DRASTICALLY. I AM A FAN OF THE FIRST ORIGINAL LACOSTE GRAY SINCE IT WAS FIRST SPRAYED ONTO MY SKIN. THE SMELL PLUS THE LASTING EFFECT WAS SUPERB! BUT THE LACOSTE RED COLOGNE WAS A TOTAL LET DOWN BECAUSE ALTHOUGH HAD A GREAT SCENT, THE LAST EFFECT WAS MAYBE 25-30 MINUTES IF SPRAYED WITH A HIGH AMOUNT. THIS LACOSTE RED DID NOT STAY ON ME FOR LONG AT ALL. THANK YOU FOR READING MY REVIEW. <text>

This is wonderful as a hand cream, but as a face cream, I'm not impressed. It does moisturize nicely, but I haven't seen evidence it's doing anything else. I'll be using this for my hands and switching back to Alpha-Hydrox from here on out.<text>

<text>Not one of Timothy's Best
I found this to be one of Timothy's least flavorful coffees.  As mentioned by other reviewers, the pumpkin flavor was slight.  I also found that it had a 'watered-down' coffee flavor...and I did make it in the 'small' cup option.German Chocolate Cake is my favorite so far and Winter Carnival is a close second.<text>

<text>Fusion Power blades cost more, work worse
Hey guys,I originally bought a Fusion power when it came out and used it for a week - I decided I didn't like it as much as my M3 Power and put it aside. The blades felt like they were scraping too closely against my skin and I found it to be an overall fairly uncomfortable shaving experience, without getting noticeably closer than the M3 Power.A year or so later, my M3 Power stopped working, so I ran out to the store and picked up some normal Fusion replacement cartridges (not Fusion Power!) instead of buying a new razor altogether. The experience was completely different from what I remembered! The razor just glided over my skin, I never felt like I had to go back over areas, it was incredibly comfortable, and, most importantly, an extremely close shave!Surprised, I wondered what it could be, and realized that it might be the blades making the difference. I picked up some Fusion Power replacements and tried them side by side and it confirmed for me - the Fusion Power blades are markedly worse than the regular Fusion blades. Don't believe me? Give it a shot yourself, I think you'll find that the best combo is to buy a Fusion Power razor and regular Fusion blades.Good luck!<text>

<text>Warning, Contains High Fructose Corn Syrup
This was my favorite cereal for years...until I read the label.  I guess I took for granted the ingredients because of the commercials and advertising of it as such a healthy cereal and even promoted it as a diet plan to lose weight.  I hope the manufacturers realize how many people discontinued purchasing this great product after educating themselves on the dangers of high fructose corn syrup.  They need to reconfigure their ingredients list to actually make something that won't be eventually blacklisted for being harmful to unsuspecting consumers.<text>

<text>Limited usefulness...better option available...
Basically a mini toothbrush with a blue alien fish egg in the middle filled with minty freshness. The opposite end has a flexible point that serves like a toothpick while overall it's about as long as my middle finger Here are the problems:1) I Could not open the package until I spotted the pull tab.  They should really make this more obvious.  Even then, you have to fish the thing out, a two handed job.  Could the packaging be bigger and waste more plastic please?  They're packaged two in one blister so with this much space I could actually store a travel toothbrush and a travel toothpaste!2) They say that you don't need a sink or water, but my experience was that after I was done using it, you have enough saliva from the minty capsule that you really want some place to spit and rinse.  You also have to be careful about how you hold it when using it, otherwise you end up with saliva on your hands.  Now you show up to your meeting with fresh breath....and sticky hands...  3) Brush is way too small (smaller than my pinky nail) so it takes a while to get good coverage - oh yeah, also those bristles are STIFF.4) Iffy ergonomics  - it's small, remember?  Oh, now it's covered with your spit, so kind of slippery too.  There's a groove to help prevent it rotating in your fingers but it does take some coordination and attention to use properly.  Forget about using it while driving.  If you try to use this after a late night at the bar - you'll probably drop it on the floor, and that puddle isn't beer.5) This product wastes a reasonable amount of plastic with each use. Of course this might be a positive if you are an environazi hatin' SUV driver and want to freshen up after eating your BK double cheeseburger with beef from clear cut rainforest...;)After using this four times I decided the only advantage this has is that it's smaller (not by much) than the smallest travel toothbrushes and you don't have to carry around any toothpaste - you can also use those without a sink if you have a kleenex to spit into.Instead, I recommend the Oral B Brush-Ups.  Oral B Brush-ups, Textured Teeth Wipes, 12 wipesThese are textured sleeves which fit over your finger, impregnated with minty freshness.  They are so small you can keep them in your wallet next to other foil covered things you might need if your breath is fresh enough.  They are much easier to open (one handed, while driving, speaking from experience) and easier to use (slip it over your finger and then rub your teeth, gums, etc)  Use it while driving, jogging, bungee-jumping, or playing tennis. If you've found this review to be helpful, please let me know!<text>

<text>Pampers Swaddlers Vs. Huggies Snugglers
I have three boys (4, 2, and 3 months) and so I can tell you my favorite diapers for them (I don't know about how they fit for little girls!) I have always loved Pampers Swaddlers for sizes N, 1, 2 but I had a coupon for these and tried them out. I am only somewhat happy with them (and these are supposed to be their premium diapers, right?!). In the the last week I have gotten peed on many times (even when the diaper isn't that full) and they're just not as soft or cut as nicely as the Swaddlers. I love the regular Huggies when they get to size 3 but for new little guys these didn't cut it for me. I won't be buying them again. And for people looking for a good overnight diaper you don't have to double up you can get Huggies Overnites Diapers or Pampers Baby Dry Overnight Extra Protection Diapers--tried both and they're great (once the kids are sleeping through the night!)<text>

<text>Pretty bad
I've found that most Glutino products taste quite good. However, I was very disappointed in the breakfast bars. I tried the apple and the blueberry. They both have kind of a bitter taste and you can hardly taste the fruit. They are edible but not very enjoyable. Some folks might feel differently about the taste but, if I were you, I would try one box from a health food store, before I ordered boxes and boxes of them from Amazon. <text>

I use floss regularly.  I bought this hoping this will last more number of weeks than the little packs.  This floss is very thick.  Me, my wife, and kids all have trouble getting it b/w teeth.  It has to be pushed hard to get in between teeth.  When we do it hurts as it pushes teeth apart (yes it is very thick).<text>

<text>Go fish
I was trying to find a fish oil supplement for my kids.  We tried the chewable gummy fish by L'il Critter and my son and daughter hated them.  So I decided to buy something you can mix in food.  I made sure they did not know it was fish oil and had them taste it.  My son's first comment was, "It tastes like the bass spray Daddy uses on his fishing lures."  Of course he has never tasted the bass spray, but has smelled it when his dad used it. Bass spray is pretty much made of fish oil. So, I think there is no hiding the fishy taste for some people.  I tried mixing a 1/2 tsp. in a whole smoothie and it was terrible I couldn't even drink it.  I will try mixing it in something else, but so far we think it tastes quite fishy.<text>

<text>Won't use it again
I didn't see much changes after 7 days. It bleached my gum and peeled the gum between my two front teeth, and it also irritated my tongue. However, all this discomfort were bearable. I am not going to buy it again because it didn't bleach my teeth much. I had a lot of foam and saliva during the treatment, so I am not sure if that is the reason the outcome wasn't so good. I used Colgate whitening gel before, and it didn't work either. Therefore, I decide that I am going to let dentist bleach my teeth next time. Hopefully, I would have better luck. Use it before you brush your teeth will reduce the irritation to your gum and teeth. I could go for 45 minutes when I used it before I brushed my teeth. <text>

<text>Not quite the miracle we were expecting...
After reading the reviews on Amazon and researching food ideas online I got some friends together and we all divulged.  Out of the seven of us who took it, three of us just felt sick after the process.  All of us concluded that while our taste buds were playing tricks on us, they were not necessarily good tricks.  I wouldn't say sour things tasted sweet for instance, I would say they tasted weird kind of like lychees but not very good ones.  The only thing I tried that really improved after dissolving the pill on my tongue was a Coors light.  It tasted like a pretty good Pilsner after the pill, and everyone seemed to like this, but sometimes a nice cold Coors light is just what you need, so...  If you have nothing left to spend your money on, this isn't the worst choice in the world, but don't expect a miracle, because that is not going to happen.  Expect a stomach ache, a loss of appetite, and then you won't find disappointment.<text>

It's a great price, especially with the super saver discount but they just aren't working for us. Like someone else said, the rolls run out very quickly.

This consistency of this product is not what I expected for a supposed facial cleanser. It feels like I'm washing my face with lotion. It does not leave my face feeling clean. In fact, it left a slight residue which aggravated my combination skin. I ended up having to wash it off with soap. So far I haven't found anything that comes close to Aveeno Active Naturals Ultra-Calming Foaming Cleanser, Fragrance-Free, 6-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 3), which leaves my skin feeling clean and soothed without causing dryness or irritation.<text>

I bought a number of healthy "snack" bars.  This one was nasty.  It was so bad that I considered spitting out the bite I ate. The "flavor" (there isn't much of one) is disgusting, and the texture is not good either.  I have had an actual brownie made with whey protein from a shop nearby, and it was quite good.  The Think Thin (brownie crunch) does not taste like brownies, does not have a crunch, and will make you thin because you'll rather not eat than eat it. Yuck! (I'm giving it 2 stars because it is supposedly healthy, so if you can choke it down, you at least have that going for you)<text>

<text>Multiple Keurig Coffee Taster
The idea of a Kahlua flavored coffee was quite enticing.  I like Kahlua and even bake with it.  This coffee, while not horrible, was simply bad.  I am so sorry that I have two cartons of it.  I can't give it away fast enough, although I do warn my friends that I do not like it.  While I did not detect an offending smell, there was a pronounced bitter aftertaste.<text>

Got this product after reading that xylitol gum chewing might help with a jaw problem I have been having.  This gum tastes really good at first but loses flavor really quickly.  If they could find a way to make the flavor last, it would be a winner.  If you want longer flavor, you will have to try another gum with flavor extenders.<text>

I was so disappointed in this coffee.  It seemed to leave a bitter aftertaste that lasted all day..... i tried various ways to make it taste better, and brewed it in a brand new coffee maker, but nothing changed that after taste.... The Folgers Breakfast Blend is MUCH better, and more smooth tasting.<text>

<text>Not so great
These were on sale at Shop Rite for $6.99 (12 pack) so I thought I'd give them a try. It looked very watery in the cup and also tasted watery. I prefer a rich, creamy hot cocoa and this was far from it. It also has a fake sugar aftertaste which I did not care for. I don't think I'll be buying these k-cups again.<text>

<text>Towles Leave Particles Behind (Title Misleading Too)
I would not buy this product again. The title is misleading; these do not qualify as "Mega" sided rolls. The size is actually what I would call "normal."The "Choose-A-Size" sheets are very small which is actually a plus since you can select the size you would like. However the deal breaker is that the towels break apart and leave small paper particles behind on anything that's not glass. <text>

<text>Its ok for short term use
I bought this product to replace my original battery for my LG VX8600. I would not recommend buying or using this replacement battery for longer than a 60 day period. Although this battery came newly wrapped, it quickly lost its ability to retain charge after 2 weeks of normal use. It barely holds out any better than my old battery (needs to be recharged roughly every 12 hours). I received an extra Verizon battery thru an exchange on Craigslist, and even though this battery is over 12 months old, it works much better like the original battery (I have used it for about 1 month now and I have had no problems). I would suggest getting this replacement battery only if you are looking for a temporary short term fix until you get a new or used Verizon battery. <text>

<text>Wide variation in quality
Twice in the last couple of years I've ordered the Double Bergamot tea in the bulk package of six boxes.  I've found a wide discrepancy in the amount of bergamot in the tea from box to box.  Often there seemed to be none at all in the tea bags.  Since I had several boxes on hand, and they were not old or stored improperly, my conclusion is that the quality control of this particular tea is not good. The Holiday Chai did not have this problem, and was consistently good.<text>

<text>Perhaps a bit bitter in flavor
Taste is ultimately, of course, subjective. Nonetheless, I find this brew to be bitter in its initial tasting. It hits the front of the mouth with an initial bitterness, and the other flavors do not present themselves strongly enough to overcome that first impression. I should note that I have made five cups on consecutive mornings, so it is something endemic to the brew.  I do not use cream/sugar, and those who do may find the bitterness ameliorated, and the underlying boldness of this selection should carry through such additions.<text>

<text>It just gave me a stomach ache!
My joints creak a bit with middle age, and I get stiff sitting too long or even walking a far piece.  This stuff would be great if it helped the joint inflammation, even a little.  I followed directions, only had one a day to start with meals, and I see why.  This stuff burns down there in the gut you can seriously feel the flame.  Now, I like to give it a fair chance, but especially when I went to two a days, and after about half the bottle was used up, I felt no benefits.  So why I want to give myself psuedo-indigestion twice a day would be beyond me.  Hotwings lovers, Thai food fans, spicey food fellows of all races and creeds, this may be for you.  I'm a dyed in the wool spice hater who will shy away from all things spicey anyway.  This may not be a fair review from that regard, but I see no health benefits from this stuff, at least in the short term. Unless you salivate when you hear the phrase "buffalo wings", I doubt the non-hot fan will tolerate pain in the tummy long enough to realize any long-term benefits. <text>

<text>not as good as the Giant brand
Thought I'd try this since it was similar in price to our regular coffee. Don't like the taste much, it tastes like fake flavoring. The grounds are very fine and it makes it darker and more dense - not in a good way like Starbucks coffee. I end up having to use more cream. We went back to our regular brand at Giant since we grind it fresh and a little more coarse. <text>

<text>Don't spend the money
This product does not whiten like I expected and the trays are awkward and not maliable enough to conform correctly to your teeth. Also, the gel doesn't hit every spot so the tops of my teeth aren't the same color as the base. And when you're done with it it leaves big chunks of gel in your mouth that made me gag. I also had to search all over for how long to leave them in...it's not on the instruction insert but on the box in tiny little letters. Instead of these go with Crest Professional Whitestrips. You can't get them in stores--I could only find them online.<text>

<text>Vending machine coffee tastes better
I can't say I'd recommend this coffee.  If not for the convenience, I wouldn't ever have rebought it, but now I've found a better choice for regular coffee in the Tassimo - either Starbucks Breakfast Blend, or Jacobs Kronung.  Both beat this coffee hands down in flavor.  The Jacobs doesn't make as much coffee though.This coffee tastes like vending machine coffee at a highway rest stop - the kind from a machine that hasn't been tended to recently.  Thin and yucky.  Sorry, Gevalia fans.  They make a good espresso, though, and the latte and cappuccino choices are much better.Pass on this one if you're not sure and try one of the others.<text>

<text>More Cookies than Nutrition
The name of these "Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars" might lead one to believe they have some whole grain nutritional value. But when you read the packaging the only nutrition comes additives. There is no fiber to speak of and they are loaded with high fructose corn syrup. I use them when my blood sugar drops too low much as I would a piece of candy. These travel pretty well and do give you a bit of volume so you don't feel hungry but they are far from being a healthy food choice. <text>

<text>not authentic
I purchased two bottles of exactly the same product, the bottle was about $21. The fragrance was not authentic for sure, since the person who is using it has been a long-term user. We always purchased it from department stores before. So in this case there is no bargain, the fragrance is slightly different, and it wears out very quickly, and you get what you pay for....and this is the rub, it is impossible to return, since it is alcohol, amazon considers it a flammable item, and thus dangerous.hope this helps.T<text>

<text>Shrinkage and oily residue
I used this product with a vintage, off-white, wool cardigan I wear quite a bit. The sweater wasn't noticeably dirty or smelly, but I wear it so often I figured it could use a cleaning. It game out with a definite "newness. The wool has a renewed fluffiness, it's noticeably cleaner and smelling fresh. However, it was also noticeably smaller. It's still wearable, but being tall, the cuffs are riding uncomfortably high on my wrists now. Handling it also leaves an oily residue on my hands. I haven't read reports of this anywhere else, so I thought I'd let people know. It's not subtle either. Just brushing against it with my hand leaves some kind of oil. Oily chemicals. Yuck...<text>

<text>Sugar in the Jerky
Short and Sweet:  this jerky is quite sweet, compared to commercial jerky.  In a one ounce portion, there are seven (7) grams of carbohydrates.  For those on a low-carb diet, that is a significant amount.I notice that in the more "natural" jerkies, they tend to use more sugar.  Perhaps it helps the texture and make the jerky a little less likely to dry out.It does show this on the label, which Amazon makes available, so don't make the same mistake I did and buy impulsively.If you are trying to find a beef jerky without preservatives, and from animals raised without antibiotics, etc, then this product is acceptable, if a little sweet.  But if you are on a high protein diet, avoiding carbohydrates, then beware.<text>

<text>Another Brand is Better
There was a pumpkin shortage in our local supermarkets, so I resorted to ordering this case online.  Besides the fact that ten out of the twelve cans were dented, I used one can out of pure desperation.  Yes, I was desperate for pumpkin.  It's watery.  It's not solid packed.  And using the same ingredients I always do in the dish I used it, it was sub par.  I have since sent the product back mainly because of the dented situation - otherwise, I probably would have given it to a food bank or something - they don't take dented cans either and rightfully so!  Amazon took it back and I'm sure will be crediting my money.  I WISH I HAD READ THE OTHER COMMENTS before I purchased this.  Beware of dented cans.<text>

<text>Has no effect on anything
Sorry to be blunt, but all this product does is spread a layer of sticky, shiny residue under your eyes, which is supposed to give the illusion of "smoothness." Unfortunately, if you rub or touch under your eyes at any point afterwards, the "smoothness" rubs off and collects in little residual pieces that get in your eyes and all over your face. Not pretty.It gets two stars for the ease of application. The roller is convenient and easy to use. But it doesn't make you look younger or less puffy. <text>

<text>DECEPTIVE DESCRIPTION 160 WASHES ONLY FOR FRONT LOADERS
I just received this product in the mail and am using it for the first time so I can't comment on the effectiveness as a detergent, but I do have to say that the Amazon description is deceptive.  The descriptions says each box cleans 160 loads per box but this is only if you have a front loading washer.  If you have a top loading washer, the box only cleans 80 loads which brings the cost per load up to 18 cents per wash (includes tax, no shipping) instead of 8 cents as originally calculated.  Even when  you enlarge the picture of the box on the site it is hard to read the fine print saying 80 loads for top loaders, 160 for front loaders.  This product better be stellar otherwise I will switch to another product based on the cost.<text>

<text>Smells good... at first.... 
When I initially purchased this I really liked the smell, I would usually spray some for day events or dates do to the light not-so-strong scent. When making the purchase, I purchased the bundled version that contained the cologne (spray) bottle and the after shave (pour) bottle. Majority of the time I just used the after shave bottle, and occasionally the cologne bottle. All was well until roughly 8-9 months out. The scent from the cologne bottle now smells very rancid, I actually had to change clothes because it just didn't smell right. I thought maybe it was just me so I sniffed the after shave bottle to compare. Surely enough, they were both different in smell. Not only did the cologne bottle smell rancid, the aftershave (although didn't smell as rancid) did start to smell sorta acidic. Overall I am very disappointed with the products shelf life. I have had polo sports bottles from high school that lasted longer then this defective product. If this is your way for a cost reduction to raise gross margins, then Tsk Tsk on you Kenneth Cole. <text>

<text>Not the same as the prescription.
At first I was surprised and happy to find this available online so I tried a bottle.  At first, it appears to be the same as what was prescribed to me by my dermatologist.  The one thing I did notice was that it was not as thick as the prescription version...then I read the label.  Ingredients appear to be the same, but the first ingredient is WATER.  So beware if you purchase this, it is probably a watered-down version of what you would get from the prescription version.  I suspect it may or may not work for you depending on your skin condition.<text>

<text>Gas Station "Cappuccino"
&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DHM1FVP57FC9"Watch Video Here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DHM1FVP57FC9&lt;/a I am more of an espresso/americano guy, but every now and then I really love a good cappuccino. This beverage tastes like the "Cappuccino" you would get out of a gas station machine or a vending machine. The milk has a slightly weird taste and it is sweetened! Why not let customers add sugar to taste rather than over sweeten the product? The drink is not strong or bold and as a little on the watery side when made according to the included instructions. It leaves you feeling really full and heavy not like a true cappuccino you would find in a local coffee shop. If you really want a cappuccino and have one of these machines, I think you'd be a lot better pulling an Espresso shot and adding your own fresh milk (yes, that does mean you'll need to froth it!).Note regarding video: the reason the saucer is cracked is due to bad product packaging for the Nescafe Dolce Gusto Machine. This is how it arrived to me.<text>

<text>Too Sweet, Too Watery, tastes like a gas station beverage
&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R16NTOTEPGW8DK"Watch Video Here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R16NTOTEPGW8DK&lt;/a Trust me, I want to love this coffee. The machine is so easy to use/clean. But the coffee is watery, too sweet and just not very good. Take a look at the nutritional contents as well: 4g of Fat, 9g of Sugar, etc... Ouch... See video for demo/review.<text>

<text>Some of the muffin tops are good
The brownies are not very good, one has pieces of pomegranate in it and the other just has an odd flavor and consistency.  The muffin tops are good but you have to immediately freeze everything and then leave 1 out for awhile to get to room temp before you eat it.<text>

<text>Of course kids love it, it's full of "evaporated cane juice"
The good news is that toddlers and older children LOVE this cereal, which some parents (seeking gluten free alternatives for their children) would be happy with. The bad news is that it is loaded with "evaporated cane juice" - also known as SUGAR. Calling it evaporated cane juicemay sound healthy, but it's just silly. This is a super sweet, super sugary cereal, and no matter how much my toddler likes it I will not give it to him ever again because of its high sugar content.<text>

These get worse with every bite.  I even tried putting peanut butter on top to cover the taste.  That didn't work.  My five-year-old likes them.  That is the only reason I didn't rate it lower.<text>

I love white chocolate so I was hoping that this would give me a creamy white mocha taste with my coffee.  But boy, my hope was destroyed be it was way sweet and no creamy taste at all.  Don't buy this if you're looking for creamy white mocha/chocolate taste.<text>

<text>Not great
I think anyone into cologne or perfume has smelled this (assuming they haven't owned it) on at least a dozen others.Curve is the kind of scent you would expect to find littered around a college campus. Its a heavy synthetic smell, with a brutal starting point bubbling with artificial lavender and berry, and finishing to a warm but overbearing citrus and sandalwood base. Curve smells good if its applied extremely lightly, but this is never the case.The target audience would be young men ages 14-21. I bought my first bottle (the four ounce) when I was a freshman in high school, and I haven't been able to finish even half of the bottle through the years.Prospective buyers should definitely give it a test run.<text>

<text>Poor quality defeats purpose
The idea behind this product is sound, and when you can get the blamed cap on securely it works, but that isn't often.  The cap and the top of the pot are threaded, but getting the threads to engage is an exercise in futility.  After enough fiddling, you can get the top on somewhat well, but by that time the water inside is no longer warm.  Since flushing your sinuses with cold water is unpleasant, you will end up using the pot with more water escaping from the under the cap than from the spout.<text>

<text>NOT 3.5 OZ. PER BAG!
Wrong info. under Product Features. It claims each bag contains 3.5 ounces. I received my box of 36 bags today, and every bag is only 2.9 ounces. So, instead of the 126 ounces claimed, they only send 104.4 ounces total. The difference is 7.44 ounces, or enough for another 7.44 bags of popcorn! It would also be nice if one could call up the Nutrition Facts of food products on Amazon - then I would have known O.R.'s Natural has 300mg of sodium per serving, compared to O.R.'s Light Butter at only 190mg of sodium/serving. Calling Natural "Simply Salted" implied to me less salt, and so I find it misleading. Posting Nutrition Facts would eliminate ambiguity and make things clear for customers.<text>

<text>Does NOT taste like Cashews
This product is made from the Cashew fruit, not the cashew nut, so don't be expecting a delicious cashew flavored drink.  This tastes more like a combination of pear and pineapple juice, with a slightly gritty texture.  And despite it being packaged in the familiar cardboard-like single serving container, it has a faint canned juice taste. It isn't bad, but not something I would chose to drink.<text>

<text>Cherries were the pits
I didn't have a problem with the taste, and I appreciate that they had no added sugar, but there were tons of pits. I was disappointed. Also, they don't stay good that long, it's a large bag that isn't re-sealable, and an invitation to bugs. Never finished them.<text>

<text>Changes in Power Gel's Formulation
Agree with the previous user / review.  The new formulation is much much much saltier than the prior generation of Power Gel.  Not that we don't need electrolytes during activity, but if you are thinking of this as the old style gel.... it really is not.  This is more of a concentrated electrolyte drink that has very little similarity to the other products I use -- Hammer and GU.... no more branched chain amino acids and no more antioxidants.  I suggest GU for great taste and all of the key ingredients for a great energy gel.<text>

I prefer steel-cut oats to the rolled oats.  My local grocery store stopped carrying the McCann's.  So I am glad to know that Amazon carries the product.  McCann's is great with milk, a bit of sugar, and fresh fruit.<text>

<text>It's Nasty. Tastes like Pepto-Bismol
I recommend buying ONE can of this somewhere FIRST to see if you like it before you buy a whole case. I read all these reviews saying this was great tasting stuff. All I have to say is- dang, I'd hate to taste the BAD stuff!!  I was very surprised when I got my case of Vanilla Zoic and I couldn't gag it down. It has a very odd taste. It's a chalky-metallic, very artificial (and not in a good way) taste and it took me a while to figure out what it reminded me of- then it hit me- PEPTO BISMOL. And no, I 'm not kidding.  Maybe the chocolate is better?  The nutrition in this is hard to beat, but I just wish they could make it taste a little better. I have to mix fat free choc syrup into this just so I can stand it (because after all, I do have a whole case to drink!)- which sucks because it adds extra calories. Listen, I'm not a picky person... I'm a girl who eats a lot of low calorie stuff and I'm very used to this kind of thing, but this is just nasty, I'm sorry. Not a good review here. I got the recommendation from Hungry Girl and usually their reviews are spot-on, but this stuff... not so much.  But hey, you may be like the others and LIKE it. If you are, then good... because you'll have a whole case to drink. <text>

<text>Most should look elsewhere for their energy
The recommended dose for these "chews" is 2 chews, which has the caffeine equivalent of 1/4 cup of coffee.  But the top 2 ingredients are sugar and corn syrup.  You will likely get a small boost from these, and probably not feel too bad about the sugar because they've got vitamins in 'em too.In fact, while I was hoping it'd taste like a Starbust, it instead tastes like children's vitamins.  I disagree that it has a nice taste.  It's tart, "vitaminy", with a somewhat unpleasant aftertaste.I'd go elsewhere for my "boost".... i.e., 3 minutes of stretching and deep breathing, perhaps!<text>

<text>Smells great but not worth the $
I decided to try this shampoo and conditioner because my salon is now using Bumble and Bumble products and my stylist was raving about the products.  The coconut smell is great but the shampoo and conditioner are just ok.  I thought that it would make my hair smooth and give it more shine, but my hair feels like I am using a cheap supermarket brand shampoo.  Also, my forehead seems to be a little on the oily side since I started using these products.  I normally have very dry skin with no blemishes.  I am kinda disappointed because I spent $50 on both the shampoo and conditioner.  I wouldn't buy these again...<text>
